        "question": "What is Social Spending?",
        "answer": "Social Spending is an app to track how much you owe or are owed to people with whom you split expenses. You can also use Social Spending to track how much a group of people owe or are owed relative to a communal 'pot' of money for the whole group."

    {
        "question": "Why should I use Social Spending?",
        "answer": "It is common for groups of friends or roommates to split expenses such as groceries, restaurant bills, or utilities. These expenses tend to occur regularly and between the same individuals. Re-payment of amounts owed between members immediately after the expense is paid results in many transactions. In addition to the time burden of coordinating these re-payments, many popular platforms for these re-payments (Paypal, Venmo, Cashapp, etc.) make the money inaccessible for several days.\n\n\nSocial Spending provides stateful tracking of how much you owes or are owed relative to the group with whom you are splitting expenses. You can then use the amount of how much everyone in the group owes to inform who will pay for future expenses on behalf of the other group members."
