<h1>Wt Release notes</h1>

This file lists important notes on migrating existing applications to
newer version of Wt. It lists changes in the library that may break
the way you build Wt, the way you configure Wt or the Wt API and
behaviour.

<h2>Release 4.10.2 (November 8, 2023)</h2>

<p>
  Wt 4.10.2 is a patch release that addresses the following issues:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/11932">Issue #11932</a>:
    when calling <a href="classWt_1_1WPushButton.html#ae919cb76993211553b50a996bdf80fe9">WPushButton::setMenu</a> after a <a href="classWt_1_1WPopupMenu.html">WPopupMenu</a> had already been added,
    the second menu wasn't added to the button, and both <code>WPopupMenu</code>s were removed. Now, the new <code>WPopupMenu</code> is correctly added to the button.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/11974">Issue #11974</a>: when dynamically making a field visible in <a href="classWt_1_1Form_1_1Dbo_1_1FormView.html">FormView</a> the form would only show the label and not the corresponding widget. This has now been corrected by having <code>FormView</code> override <a href="classWt_1_1WTemplateFormView.html#ab8ba5bda25fbf612903e5e0fa52f75ae">createFormWidget</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/11984">Issue #11984</a>:
    corrected <a href="classWt_1_1WTableView.html">WTableView</a>'s drag &amp; drop functionality. When a <a href="classWt_1_1WAbstractItemModel.html">WAbstractItemModel</a>'s items have the flags for drag &amp; drop enabled (found in <a href="group__modelview.html#ga1d77c4de293aebfacbdde124de06b8b0">ItemFlag</a>), the <a href"classWt_1_1WAbstractItemView.html">WAbstractItemView</a> has <a href="classWt_1_1WAbstractItemView.html#a0ca99b835708d990b90000917045738e">setDragEnabled(true)</a> and <a href="classWt_1_1WAbstractItemView.html#a5469c23ea1e9066e98e832ec9da2af21">setEnabledDropLocations()</a> set to <a href="namespaceWt.html#a46e584f830f2d8c9f5b16fcee7affc9b">DropLocation::BetweenRows</a>, the view will now correctly drop the items at the location indicated by the cursor, and will no longer cause an issue when moving the cursor out of the table when dragging.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/11890">Issue #11890</a>:
    if a user were to delete a <a href="classWt_1_1WPopupWidget.html">WPopupWidget</a>, which they can do as detailed in the <a href="classWt_1_1WPopupWidget.html#details">documentation</a>, they would encounter a use-after-free.
    This has been corrected, so that the content of a <code>WPopupWidget</code> can be removed when being hidden.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/11985">Issue #11985</a>:
    ensures that if a <a href="classWt_1_1WStringListModel.html">WStringListModel</a> is used in a <a href="classWt_1_1WTableView.html">WTableView</a> that allows drag & drop, the content of the
    model is correctly updated.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.emweb.be/issues/12012">Issue #12012</a>:
    due to an oversight in <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/10512">Issue #10512</a>, the keyboard and mouse events for a <a href="classWt_1_1WTreeView.html">WTreeView</a>'s node were missing.
  </li>
    <a href="https://redmine.emweb.be/issues/11882">Issue #11882</a>:
    the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/fieldset">fieldset</a> element, used by <a href="classWt_1_1WGroupBox.html">WGroupBox</a> has been corrected when using Bootstrap 5.
    A default HTML value was used here, which caused the content to not be rendered correctly.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/12006">Issue #12006</a>
    a JavaScript error could occur if no semicolon was added to the JS code when called by <a href="classWt_1_1WWidget.html#ab876fc1b7d2e4e5dfc631e380d406ae2">setJavaScriptMember</a> or <a href="classWt_1_1DomElement.html#a76e75e4259fee4d00f15170eb464682e">callJavaScript</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/11897">Issue #11897</a>:
    fixed a log that was not configurable. The response to a HTTP request was always logged (like <code>GET /path contentlength</code>).
    All logs should be configurable, hence it is now logged under <code>info:wthttp</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/11959">Issue #11959</a>:
    the <code>GetOnePixel</code> deprecation warning from GraphicsMagick was removed.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/7196">Issue #7196</a>:
    remove a deprecated Pango call. If you compile with Pango enabled, you will no longer see the warning that <code>pango_fc_font_(un)lock_face</code> is deprecated.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Release 4.10.1 (September 20, 2023)</h2>

<p>
  Wt 4.10.1 is a patch release that addresses the following issues:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/10512">Issue #10512</a>:
    ensures that the disabled state of any <a href="classWt_1_1WWebWidget.html">WWebWidget</a> or <a href="classWt_1_1WCompositeWidget.html">WCompositeWidget</a> is correctly propagated to its children.
    Before, if a user set a widget as disabled that contained children like a <a href="classWt_1_1WMenu.html">WMenu</a>, a new <a href="classWt_1_1WMenuItem.html">WMenuItem</a> could be added, that was enabled.
    For some of the affected widgets, this meant that the new item could not be selected, since the signal was not exposed, but in some cases, like with a <code>WMenu</code> this was still possible.
    The disabled state of a widget now propagates to its children so that a disabled state can be set consistently for a parent. This doesn't actually set <a href="classWt_1_1WCompositeWidget.html#af0186120a0adf80edbc11bc600913ce0">setDisabled()</a> of the children.
    This state can be set separately to manage the child's disabled state without regard to its parent.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/11804">Issue #11804</a>:
    the <a href="classWt_1_1WEmailValidator.html">WEmailValidator</a> was corrected. There was a missing case in the client side regex that did not allow a hyphen in the domain of an email address.
    The server side regex was correct, but nevertheless the case has been added to the tests.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/7645">Issue #7645</a>:
    a <a href="classWt_1_1WAnchor.html">WAnchor</a> loaded through JavaScript, with progressive bootstrap will correctly add an empty "href" attribute.
    This allows the item to be selected on the page by pressing the Tab button, allowing keyboard navigation.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/11848">Issue #11848</a>:
    this corrects an edge-case in <a href="classWt_1_1WSuggestionPopup.html">WSuggestionPopup</a> where forcibly displaying the pop-up via C++ code would cause it to be unfiltered.
  </li>
  <li>
    This is a combination of <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/9595">Issue #9595</a> and <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/9596">Issue #9596</a>:
    where the Postgres backend will again rely on standard library functionality (which was substituted in <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/9490">Issue #9490</a> for <a href="https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_65_0/libs/spirit/doc/html/spirit/introduction.html">boost::spirit</a>).
    This implementation, however, caused the loss of some precision with floats and doubles. The conversion from and to string now happens with the standard library <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/header/charconv">charconv</a>, which is available in C++17 (or in C++14 as an extension).
    In case this library is not available, Wt will fall back to <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string/stof">std::stof</a> and <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string/stof">std::stoi</a>, but will still use <code>boost::spirit</code> in case of subnormals (which would result in an out_of_range exception).
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/11769">Issue #11769</a>:
    The MySQL backend will now correctly catch the <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_client_interaction_timeout">ER_CLIENT_INTERACTION_TIMEOUT</a> error.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/11302">Issue #11302</a>:
    when closing a HTTP socket, it was possible that the server just started handling a TCP/SSL request. This resulted in a free-after-use for the listener.
    The listener is now first checked, so we do not get this race condition.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/11408">Issue #11408</a>:
    fixed several concurrency issues in the wthttp library.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/11852">Issue #11852</a>:
    the <a href="classWt_1_1Mail_1_1Message.html">Message</a>'s date header was corrected. In case that a localized abbreviation was defined for the month or day, this string was placed in the header.
    Some providers / exchanges may reject these emails, since they follow RFC-5322 (<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5322#page-14">see here</a>) and expect English names.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Release 4.10.0 (May 30, 2023)</h2>

<p>
  Wt 4.10.0 mainly features back-end improvements and some new features that provide some convenience.
  There were some issues with persisting dates and time in Sqlite3.
</p>

<p>
  In some cases user will have to change some things about their CMake set-up:
  If users wish to use <code>OpenGL</code>, they may need to provide a <code>GLEW</code> installation with <code>GLEW_ROOT</code>,
  since <code>GLEW</code> is no longer bundled with Wt.
</p>

<h3>New features</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/7279">Issue #7279</a>:
    added <a href="classWt_1_1WEmailEdit.html">WEmailEdit</a> and
    <a href="classWt_1_1WEmailValidator.html">WEmailValidator</a>, implementing
    a <code>&lt;input type="email"&gt;</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/8760" target="_blank">Issue #8760</a>:
    extended <a href="classWt_1_1Auth_1_1AuthWidget.html">Auth::AuthWidget</a> with the option to resend verificiation emails. When email verification is configured to be required and the email somehow got lost, the user would be stuck not being able to log in.
    When the user tries to log in now, an info message will be shown saying they need to verify their email first along with a new button to resend the verification email. The user must then enter the email address again in a dialog before the email is sent.<br/>
    The virtual methods <a href="classWt_1_1Auth_1_1AuthWidget.html#a42f87508868746e5ccef5695fcbd8763">AuthWidget::letResendEmailVerification()</a> and <a href="classWt_1_1Auth_1_1AuthWidget.html#af45dea06ac5751e96499d62507fea69d">AuthWidget::createResendEmailVerificationView()</a> can be used to customize the UI.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/7814" target="_blank">Issue #7814</a>:
    The <code>SameSite</code> attribute of the <code>Set-Cookie</code> HTTP header is now rendered by Wt. To avoid adding yet another parameter to the <code>WApplication::setCookie()</code> method, the class <a href="classWt_1_1Http_1_1Cookie.html">Http::Cookie</a> was introduced that allows configuring all cookie attributes using setters. Objects of this type can be passed to the new <a href="classWt_1_1WApplication.html#a5a76e2ae72a7ba5624c3dc12897728f5">setCookie()</a> and <a href="classWt_1_1WApplication.html#add89ecede3de74cb2338337ca730b2dc">removeCookie()</a> methods in <code>WApplication</code>.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Other improvements</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/11384" target="_blank">Issue #11384</a>:
    it was possible for
    <a href="classWt_1_1Mail_1_1Client.html#af7bf43e793d265034c6cb343636b4024">Mail::Client::connect()</a> to
    throw an exception if the DNS resolver failed to resolve the SMTP server's hostname. We changed this to
    log an error and return <code>false</code> instead (as indicated by its documentation).
    <a href="classWt_1_1Mail_1_1Client.html#a958089e2b169f9baed3107b40b958bb9">Mail::Client::send()</a> could
    cause a null pointer to be dereferenced, either because a TLS connection was attempted while Wt was
    built without OpenSSL, or because the user did not call
    <a href="classWt_1_1Mail_1_1Client.html#af7bf43e793d265034c6cb343636b4024">Mail::Client::connect()</a> first.
    <code>send()</code> was fixed to log an error and return <code>false</code> instead.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="classWt_1_1WServer.html#aa17f85dc130b616b3fcf63aa857ff579">WServer::addResource()</a>
    can now take a <code>shared_ptr</code> instead of a raw pointer,
    enforcing that the resource lives at least as long as the server, unless removed with
    <a href="classWt_1_1WServer.html#a9f5a82118198a1d2341fb89572fd8693">WServer::removeEntryPoint()</a>.
    The overload that takes a raw pointer is now deprecated.
    This also fixes <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/11301" target="_blank">issue #11301</a>, where there
    could be a use-after-free in <code>test.http</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/11412" target="_blank">Issue #11412</a>:
    shift-click to open a new window did not work for links to internal paths. Shift-click is now handled by the browser, like ctrl- and meta-click.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.emweb.be/issues/11604" target="_blank">Issue #11604</a>:
    added a virtual destructor to <a href="classWt_1_1Form_1_1WAbstractFormDelegate.html">WAbstractFormDelegate</a>
    to ensure proper deletion and explicitly removed the copy and move constructor and assignment operator.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.emweb.be/issues/11562" target="_blank">Issue #11562</a>:
    The tutorials
    (<a href="../../tutorial/wt.html" target="_blank">Wt</a>,
    <a href="../../tutorial/dbo.html" target="_blank">Dbo</a>, and
    <a href="../../tutorial/auth.html" target="_blank">Auth</a>)
    were updated to be built with Asciidoctor instead of the legacy Python implementation,
    its style was updated to match the JWt website style, and the text was brought up to
    date a bit. The blog example was likewise updated to use Asciidoctor.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.emweb.be/issues/11210" target="_blank">Issue #11210</a>:
    <a href="classWt_1_1WTable.html#a03df7cedfb502dcc010493d4a71ee53c">WTable::headerCount()</a>
    has been made <code>const</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    The obsolete CMake options
    <code>ENABLE_EXT</code>, <code>WT_NO_STD_LOCALE</code> and <code>WT_NO_STD_WSTRING</code>
    were removed.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Bug fixes</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/11426" target="_blank">Issue #11426</a>:
    <a href="classWt_1_1Dbo_1_1backend_1_1Sqlite3.html">Sqlite3</a>:
    fixed multiple issues with dates and timestamps:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Timestamps before 1970 would not be saved properly on Windows, because of limitations
        of the <code>gmtime</code> function on Windows. The new implementation uses the
        <a href="https://github.com/HowardHinnant/date" target="_blank">date</a>
        library instead.
      </li>
      <li>
        There was a bug in the conversion to a date time string if
        <a href="namespaceWt_1_1Dbo_1_1backend.html#a834555b81f67cf1e17b6e73d1a948067">ISO8601AsText</a>
        was set as the
        <a href="classWt_1_1Dbo_1_1backend_1_1Sqlite3.html#a571f4019950aafc2b855d46d4e7072d5">date time storage</a>.
        For timestamps before 1970 the millisecond part would be saved as a negative integer, e.g.
        December 31, 1969 23:59:59.999 would be saved as
        <code>1970-01-01T00:00:00.0-1</code> instead of <code>1969-12-31T23:59:59.999</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        There was a bug in the conversion to and from Julian days if
        <a href="namespaceWt_1_1Dbo_1_1backend.html#a834555b81f67cf1e17b6e73d1a948067">JulianDaysAsReal</a>
        was set as the
        <a href="classWt_1_1Dbo_1_1backend_1_1Sqlite3.html#a571f4019950aafc2b855d46d4e7072d5">date time storage</a>.
        The decimal part was divided by 1000, and it was ahead by 12 hours due to it using
        midnight rather than noon 1 January 4713 BCE as the reference timestamp. It is now
        consistent with SQLite's own
        <a href="https://sqlite.org/lang_datefunc.html" target="_blank">julianday()</a>
        function.
      </li>
      <li>
        There was a bug in the conversion to UNIX timestamps if
        <a href="namespaceWt_1_1Dbo_1_1backend.html#a834555b81f67cf1e17b6e73d1a948067">UnixTimeAsInteger</a>
        was set as the
        <a href="classWt_1_1Dbo_1_1backend_1_1Sqlite3.html#a571f4019950aafc2b855d46d4e7072d5">date time storage</a>.
        The date part was discarded, and the time was saved as a number of milliseconds instead of seconds.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.emweb.be/issues/11578" target="_blank">Issue #11578</a>:
    fixed an issue with the <a href="namespaceWt_1_1Form_1_1Dbo.html">Dbo forms</a> not correctly validating
    invalid <a href="classWt_1_1WDate.html">WDate</a> and <a href="classWt_1_1WTime.html">WTime</a> values
    causing the forms to clear the values. Now the forms will give a validation error and prompt the user to
    correct it before saving the form.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/11377" target="_blank">Issue #11377</a>:
    when using wtisapi with WebSockets enabled in the <code>wt_config.xml</code>, Wt would
    try and fail to establish a WebSockets connection (this is not supported by ISAPI). Wt
    now disables WebSockets (and notifies this in the logs) when using ISAPI.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/11423" target="_blank">Issue #11423</a>:
    <a href="classWt_1_1WResource.html#a12b871c53120ad1c7c708210f60422be">WResource::internalPath()</a>
    now returns the empty string for static resources, since it doesn't make sense for static resources.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.emweb.be/issues/10485" target="_blank">Issue #10485</a>:
    fixed an issue where Wt would not build on Apple platforms with <code>ENABLE_OPENGL=ON</code>.
    This changes the CMake setup, so that we now rely on built-in <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FindOpenGL.html" target="_blank">FindOpenGL</a> and <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FindGLEW.html" target="_blank">FindGLEW</a> modules.
    As a consequence, the bundled GLEW installation was removed. This means that a GLEW installation will need to be
    provided when building Wt from source. CMake will find GLEW if it is installed in a standard location.
    The <code>GLEW_ROOT</code> CMake variable can be used if it is installed elsewhere.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/11376" target="_blank">Issue #11376</a>:
    fixed an issue with redirects when using wtfcgi.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Release 4.9.2 (April 18, 2023)</h2>

<p>
  Wt 4.9.2 is a patch release that addresses the following issues:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.emweb.be/issues/11262" target="_blank">Issue #11262</a>:
    fixed an issue where 32 bit Linux builds could cause <code>stat()</code> to
    fail with <code>EOVERFLOW</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/11424" target="_blank">Issue #11424</a>:
    fixed redundant calls of
    <a href="classWt_1_1WDialog.html#afe7c5f57ddb5fd1bc67334c931401e98">WDialog::setClosable(false)</a>
    causing a "widget not in container" error to be logged.

    where the selection of a
    <a href="classWt_1_1WSuggestionPopup.html">WSuggestionPopup</a>
    was not updated when using the arrow keys. We also made sure to scroll the currently
    selected option into view when selected using the arrow keys.

<h2>Release 4.9.1 (January 20, 2023)</h2>

<p>
  Wt 4.9.1 is a patch release that addresses the following issues:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/11230" target="_blank">Issue #11230</a>:

    where widgets would incorrectly believe they were still
    <a href="classWt_1_1WWidget.html#a7bffb7966160ff8a58fff9d31ef21078">rendered</a> when unsuspending.
    This would cause problems with e.g. <a href="classWt_1_1WTextEdit.html">WTextEdit</a>
    inside of a
    <a href="classWt_1_1WTemplate.html">WTemplate</a>.

    fixed compilation on 32-bit Raspberry Pi OS: Wt now links with <code>-latomic</code>
    if necessary.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Release 4.9.0 (December 22, 2022)</h2>

<p>
  Wt 4.9.0 features a lot of changes under the hood: we have painstakingly removed jQuery from Wt,
  modernized the JavaScript, and added a linter, formatter, and a new minifier in the process.
</p>

<p>
  A more directly noticeable change is the fact that we gave the documentation a new lick of paint using the
  Doxygen Awesome theme. Also, now that we added some tooling to customize WBootstrap5Theme, the
  <a href="https://webtoolkit.eu/widgets" target="_blank">widget gallery</a>'s
  primary color was updated to be more in line with Wt's website.
</p>

<h3>Backwards incompatible changes</h3>

<h4>Removal of jQuery</h4>

<p>
  We removed every use of jQuery from Wt, and jQuery is now no longer automatically loaded.
  This means that if you relied on the included jQuery version (for example, the <code>$</code> object or function),
  you will have to make some changes to make it work with Wt 4.9.0. There are several options:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Replace your uses of jQuery with vanilla JavaScript, which is what we did.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, the <code>$</code> function can often be replaced with
      <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelector" target="_blank">querySelector</a> or
      <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelectorAll" target="_blank">querySelectorAll</a>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Load jQuery yourself using
      <a href="classWt_1_1WApplication.html#ae88546224ed32cade783da188b145138">WApplication::require()</a>.
      <a href="classWt_1_1WApplication.html#aa2add60804ff75b3798fc270050654c5">WApplication::requireJQuery()</a>
      has been marked as deprecated.
    </p>
    <p>
    For example:
    <code>application->require("https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.1.slim.min.js", "$");</code>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Change your <code>wt_config.xml</code>, adding a <code>&lt;head-matter&gt;</code> section
      that loads jQuery through a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag:
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>
        &lt;head-matter&gt;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;script<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.1.slim.min.js"<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;integrity="sha256-w8CvhFs7iHNVUtnSP0YKEg00p9Ih13rlL9zGqvLdePA="<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;crossorigin="anonymous"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<br>
        &lt;/head-matter&gt;
      </code>
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Changes to WBootstrap5Theme</h4>

<dl>
  <dt>Collapsible panels</dt>
  <dd>
    <a href="classWt_1_1WBootstrap5Theme.html">WBootstrap5Theme</a>
    has used an
    <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/components/accordion/" target="_blank">accordion</a>
    instead of a
    <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/components/card/" target="_blank">card</a>
    for collapsible panels since its introduction in Wt 4.6.0.
    Now, <a href="classWt_1_1WPanel.html">WPanel</a> always uses a
    <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/components/card/" target="_blank">card</a>.
    This allows all panels to have a consistent appearance, regardless of whether they can be collapsed or not.
    Additionally, the
    <a href="classWt_1_1WPanel.html#aefd66ff6dd8e2a1108e70efec4eab1b5">WPanel::collapse()</a> and
    <a href="classWt_1_1WPanel.html#a2ac9a05172675559b6f988083a4fd666">WPanel::expand()</a> functions will now work
    as expected with
    <a href="classWt_1_1WBootstrap5Theme.html">WBootstrap5Theme</a>.
    This change resolves <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/10364" target="_blank">issue #10364</a>.
  </dd>
  <dt>Bootstrap 5 theme customization</dt>
  <dd>
    We've made it easier to customize the Bootstrap 5 theme.
    <a href="classWt_1_1WBootstrap5Theme.html">WBootstrap5Theme</a> now loads
    a single CSS file that is built from
    <a href="https://sass-lang.com/" target="_blank">Sass</a> source files. The
    <a href="https://github.com/emweb/wt/tree/master/examples/custom-bs-theme" target="_blank">
    custom-bs-theme example</a> shows how this allows the theme to be customized.
    The
    <a href="https://www.webtoolkit.eu/widgets" target="_blank">widget gallery</a>
    makes use of this by changing the primary color from Bootstrap's blue to the purple
    used in Wt's logo and homepage.
    This change resolves <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/9350" target="_blank">issue #9350</a>.
  </dd>
</dl>

<h3>New features</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    Added <a href="classWt_1_1WProgressBar.html#abf8547894af5efc5e5789f9fa56bdc03">
    WProgressBar::setValueStyleClass()</a>
    (<a href="https://github.com/emweb/wt/pull/131" target="_blank">PR #131</a>
    by maximiliank on GitHub).
  </li>
  <li>
    Added <a href="namespaceWt_1_1Utils.html#a13d154e4ef34ee6f8c1a90e8aaeec0dc">Wt::Utils::htmlAttributeValue()</a>
    to escape values if they are put into the value of an HTML tag.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Other improvements</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/11067" target="_blank">Issue #11067</a>:
    <a href="classWt_1_1WWidget.html#af01fbd9de70abd189c2f86171b6a1e02">animateShow()</a> and
    <a href="classWt_1_1WWidget.html#a0c236e179d5b63c3c6e98cc69e28c9bf">animateHide()</a> were overhauled to use the
    <a
      href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Animations_API"
      target="_blank">Web Animations API</a>. This fixes issues with choppy animations.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/8629" target="_blank">Issue #8629</a>:
    In order to ease maintenance, and make contributing to Wt easier, we changed the JavaScript
    minifier from the old version of Google Closure compiler we were using to
    <a href="https://terser.org/" target="_blank">terser</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/10966" target="_blank">Issue #10966</a>:
    Added a JavaScript formatter to format Wt's JavaScript code.
    Its usage is detailed in the Wt source tree at
    <a
      href="https://github.com/emweb/wt/blob/master/doc/development/javascript.md"
      target="_blank"><code>doc/development/javascript.md</code></a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    We gave our reference documentation a new lick of paint: we're now using the
    <a href="https://jothepro.github.io/doxygen-awesome-css/" target="_blank">Doxygen Awesome</a> theme,
    which also has a dark mode.
  </li>
  <li>
    Whereas trying to construct
    <a href="classWt_1_1WApplication_1_1UpdateLock.html">UpdateLock</a> with a null
    <a href="classWt_1_1WApplication.html">WApplication</a> pointer would cause a null
    pointer dereference before, it now simply yields an unsuccessful UpdateLock
    (<a href="https://github.com/emweb/wt/pull/195" target="_blank">PR #195</a>
    by Steven K&ouml;hler).
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/10395" target="_blank">Issue #10395</a>:
    <a href="classWt_1_1WPanel.html#a9671893042605eb936c7301f6de09d3f">WPanel::setTitleBar(false)</a>
    now automatically calls
    <a href="classWt_1_1WPanel.html#ace945a192f671220a5a2cda671dc37ca">WPanel::setCollapsible(false)</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/9570" target="_blank">Issue #9570</a>:
    All uses of <code>WT_CXX14</code> and <code>WT_CXX14ONLY</code> were removed in Wt's
    source code. <code>WT_CXX14</code> is now always defined, since Wt requires
    C++14. We marked <code>Wt::cpp14::make_unique</code> as deprecated, since this only
    existed because C++11 lacked <code>std::make_unique</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/10924" target="_blank">Issue #10924</a>:
    The undocumented <code>split-script</code> configuration property was removed, simplifying
    Wt's internals.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/10914" target="_blank">Issue #10914</a>:
    Changed some Boost.Phoenix includes to silence deprecation warnings.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/10911" target="_blank">Issue #10911</a>:
    Fixed OpenSSL 3.0 deprecation warnings.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/9252" target="_blank">Issue #9252</a>:
    Fixed a deprecation warning in the Pango font support implementation.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Bug fixes</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/9076" target="_blank">Issue #9076</a>:
    <a href="classWt_1_1WDateEdit.html">WDateEdit</a>
    gave a javascript error when opening the calendar popup if the
    application was rendered in
    <a href="namespaceWt.html#af4b6ed5fd28b4f5fa141b153c1107349accf2281a355c2c9cd4698ac30bea7820">WidgetSet</a>
    mode.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/10488" target="_blank">Issue #10488</a>:
    Long polling requests interrupted on the server side now no longer prevent keep alive requests from being sent,
    and thus the session from timing out. This was possible when Wt is deployed behind a reverse proxy that has
    a shorter request timeout than the <code>&lt;server-push-timeout&gt;</code>
    configured in <code>wt_config.xml</code>.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Release 4.8.3 (December 22, 2022)</h2>

<p>
  Wt 4.8.3 is a patch release that addresses the following issues:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/11105" target="_blank">Issue #11105</a>:
    Wt has a built-in redirect mechanism that prevents the <code>Referer</code> header from showing
    the session id (if the session id is in the URL). This mechanism hashes the destination
    URL with a secret to ensure that this system is not used as an
    <a
      href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Unvalidated_Redirects_and_Forwards_Cheat_Sheet.html"
      target="_blank">open redirect endpoint</a>.
    However, in order to make dedicated session process mode work properly, this secret could be overridden
    by providing a <code>Redirect-Secret</code> header, creating an open redirect endpoint.
    We have renamed this header to <code>X-Wt-Redirect-Secret</code> to better indicate the fact that this
    header is nonstandard, and will only accept this header if it is coming from a trusted reverse proxy.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/10995" target="_blank">Issue #10995</a>:
    fixed an issue with <a href="classWt_1_1WContainerWidget.html">WContainerWidget</a>
    where a session could terminate with the text "WContainerWidget: error parsing: undefined".
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/11101" target="_blank">Issue #11101</a>:
    fixed a data race when using dedicated session processes.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/8093" target="_blank">Issue #8093</a>:
    fixed an issue where the bottom axis could be clipped off of a tall
    <a href="classWt_1_1Chart_1_1WCartesianChart.html">WCartesianChart</a>
    (<a href="https://github.com/emweb/wt/pull/178" target="_blank">PR #178</a> by Apivan Tuntakurn).
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Release 4.8.2 (November 4, 2022)</h2>

<p>
  Wt 4.8.2 is a patch release that addresses the following issue:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/10970" target="_blank">Issue #10970</a>:
    Sending an <code>OPTIONS *</code> request could cause an assertion failure when trying
    to match the request to an entry point. This could cause a crash if assertions are enabled,
    though they usually aren't in production builds. Since these types of requests are not properly
    supported by <code>wthttp</code>, <code>OPTIONS *</code> requests are now rejected.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Release 4.8.1 (September 22, 2022)</h2>

<p>
  As usual, Wt 4.8.1 is a patch release, but we also added a document
  clarifying our policy on which minimum versions of libraries Wt requires
  (<a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/8801" target="_blank">issue #8801</a>).
  You can find this document in Wt's source tree at
  <a
    href="https://github.com/emweb/wt/blob/master/doc/MinimumDependencyVersions.md"
    target="_blank"><code>doc/MinimumDependencyVersions.md</code></a>.
</p>

<p>
  That aside, Wt 4.8.1 addresses the following issues:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/10909" target="_blank">Issue #10909</a>:
    <a href="classWt_1_1WPdfImage.html">WPdfImage</a>: Fixed compatibility with recent libharu
    versions (2.4.0 and up, excluding version 2.4.1).
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/10825" target="_blank">Issue #10825</a>:
    Fixed an issue in <a href="classWt_1_1WGoogleMap.html">WGoogleMap</a> where some left-over
    JavaScript code in
    <a href="classWt_1_1WGoogleMap.html#ad5b1aabd260b3b05e9888718264c40e2">setMapTypeControl</a>
    targeting the v2 API would cause a JavaScript error.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/10834" target="_blank">Issue #10834</a>:
    Fixed a regression since Wt 4.8.0 with the tests for
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/9442">issue #9442</a>,
    <code>dbo_test46</code> would fail with the MySQL/MariaDB and the SQL Server
    backends because they sort null values differently from PostgreSQL.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Release 4.8.0 (July 8, 2022)</h2>

<p>
  Wt 4.8.0 doesn't come with any big new features, but it does include some handy new
  functions here and there, and some improvements.
  We have also removed Skia from Wt because we can use
  Direct2D on Windows and GraphicsMagick on every other operating system.
</p>

<h3>Removals</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/10248" target="_blank">Issue #10254</a>:
    The Skia-based <a href="Wt_1_1WRasterImage.html">WRasterImage</a> implementation has been removed,
    since it was unmaintained and dependent on very specific Skia versions, and we have good alternatives
    with GraphicsMagick and Direct2D.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Changes in default behavior</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    Notable changes in exception handling:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/10137" target="_blank">Issue #10137</a>:
        Exceptions thrown from
        <a href="classWt_1_1WResource.html#a3a740f8cc29e2e6e4e58defc9c88b8b6">WResource::handleRequest()</a>
        are now caught and logged instead of causing a crash.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/10136" target="_blank">Issue #10136</a>:
        Uncaught exceptions emanating from
        <a href="classWt_1_1WApplication.html#a4a6f167bea94aefa8ba24f914c2fbee5">WApplication::notify()</a>
        would be sent to the browser. This exposes potentially sensitive details
        about the application to the end user. Wt now just sends a simple
        "500 Internal Server Error" without any further details. The exception details
        will still be logged.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/8660" target="_blank">Issue #8660</a>:
    The default value of
    <a href="classWt_1_1Auth_1_1OAuthService.html#a86b514d3e49a16e1004759287548e576">OAuthService::popupEnabled()</a>
    was changed from <code>true</code> to <code>false</code>.
    This means that the default method when using OAuth is always to redirect instead of using a popup.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>New features</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/9861" target="_blank">Issue #9861</a>:
    The
    <a href="https://github.com/emweb/wt/tree/master/examples/wtwithqt" target="_blank">wtwithqt</a>
    example can now be built with Qt 6.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.emweb.be/issues/10589" target="_blank">Issue #10589</a>:
    Added public getters for two members in the <a href="classWt_1_1Form_1_1Dbo_1_1FormModel.html">FormModel</a>
    and <a href="classWt_1_1Form_1_1Dbo_1_1FormView.html">FormView</a> classes that were introduced in
    <a href="https://redmine.emweb.be/issues/8622" target="_blank">issue #8622</a>. Users can now access the underlying
    database object represented by the model and the model used by the view.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/emweb/wt/pull/189" target="_blank">PR #189</a>:
    Added support for <code>long</code> in <code>Wt::Json</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/9442" target="_blank">Issue #9442</a>:
    New features for
    <a href="classWt_1_1Dbo_1_1Query.html">Wt::Dbo::Query</a>:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Added overloads for <a href="classWt_1_1Dbo_1_1Query.html#ab99203f02889f09d5ba819eec1f96dfc">Query::join()</a>,
        <a href="classWt_1_1Dbo_1_1Query.html#af2b09a60768a3d9e84cf26316cb76dd9">Query::leftJoin()</a> and
        <a href="classWt_1_1Dbo_1_1Query.html#ac5e215165a41a010bd02f0496975955c">Query::rightJoin()</a> that have
        a template parameter for the type of the database table that needs to be joined. Since Wt knows the mapping
        between the type and the database table, it automatically fills in the name of the table.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/9442" target="_blank">Issue #9442</a>:
        Added functions <a href="classWt_1_1Dbo_1_1Query.html#aad47f25e7c86f927e0b2d86c4f519f8a">Query::asString()</a>
        and <a href="classWt_1_1Dbo_1_1Query.html#abd755ac8e896597a569ab202f5afa4d6">Query::bindSubqueryValues()</a>.
        These functions make it possible to embed one query in another by converting it to a string and moving all
        its bound parameters to the other query. See
        <a href="classWt_1_1Dbo_1_1Query.html#abd755ac8e896597a569ab202f5afa4d6">Query::bindSubqueryValues()</a>
        for a basic code example.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Improvements</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/10019" target="_blank">Issue #10019</a>:
    Added a cleaner fix for <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/9922" target="_blank">issue #9922</a>.
    Instead of discarding responses containing only <code>{}</code>, Wt now no longer delineates its JavaScript
    with curly brackets.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/emweb/wt/pull/192" target="_blank">PR #192</a>:
    Removed obsolete <code>cursor: hand</code>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Bug fixes</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/9938" target="_blank">Issue #9938</a>:
    The close icon for a <a href="classWt_1_1WDialog.html">WDialog</a> was displayed on the left side
    of the title bar when using bootstrap 5. This was fixed by using the Bootstrap 5 appropriate
    <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> with the <code>btn-close</code> style class.
    A new <code>Wt.WDialog.titlebar</code> template was introduced so that the rendering
    of the title bar can be overridden.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/10599" target="_blank">issue #10599</a>:
    there were issues on macOS when using a statically built Wt library, causing the linker to output
    warnings and some test cases to fail.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/10599" target="_blank">issue #10604</a>:
    self-assignment of
    <a href="classWt_1_1Dbo_1_1Query.html">Wt::Dbo::Query</a>
    would lose bound parameters.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/emweb/wt/pull/187">PR #187</a>:
    Negative floating point numbers would always be formatted in scientific notation when
    being output as JavaScript. This has been fixed to only use scientific notation for
    particularly small or particularly large numbers.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/10248" target="_blank">Issue #10248</a>:
    Tabs have been replaced by spaces in the source code. Previously, we had a mix of tabs and spaces,
    where newer code used only spaces, and older code changed 8 spaces into a tab.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Release 4.7.3 (July 8, 2022)</h2>

<p>
  Wt 4.7.3 is a patch release that addresses the following issues:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/10341" target="_blank">Issue #10341</a>:
    Fixed an issue where JavaScript validators would incorrectly mark a <a href="classWt_1_1WLineEdit.html">WLineEdit</a>
    that used an
    <a href="classWt_1_1WLineEdit.html#a0639ec7e420ba32ffb148303a79fb969">input mask</a>
    as invalid, since they would not take the input mask into account.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/10543" target="_blank">Issue #10543</a>
    (<a href="https://github.com/emweb/wt/pull/194" target="_blank">PR #194</a>):
    The
    <a href="classWt_1_1Dbo_1_1FixedSqlConnectionPool.html#ab7291dc4ff981598a75606ac29184002">timeout</a>
    in
    <a href="classWt_1_1Dbo_1_1FixedSqlConnectionPool.html">Wt::Dbo::FixedSqlConnectionPool</a>
    was uninitialized, which caused a random timeout instead of no timeout if the timeout was left unspecified.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/10348" target="_blank">Issue #10348</a>:
    Dbo: fixed an issue where reentrant use of prepared statements with parameters with the Postgres backend could
    cause a "Binding too many parameters" exception to be thrown.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/9719" target="_blank">Issue #9719</a>
    (<a href="https://github.com/emweb/wt/pull/186" target="_blank">PR #186</a>):
    Fixed a regression where panning an interactive
    <a href="classWt_1_1Chart_1_1WCartesianChart.html">WCartesianChart</a>
    would not update the
    <a href="classWt_1_1Chart_1_1WAxisSliderWidget.html">WAxisSliderWidget</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/10362" target="_blank">Issue #10362</a>:
    <a href="classWt_1_1WPanel.html#aefd66ff6dd8e2a1108e70efec4eab1b5">WPanel::collapse()</a> and
    <a href="classWt_1_1WPanel.html#a2ac9a05172675559b6f988083a4fd666">WPanel::expand()</a>
    would cause a segmentation fault with
    <a href="classWt_1_1WBootstrap5Theme.html">WBootstrap5Theme</a>. Now they do nothing.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/emweb/wt/pull/188" target="_blank">PR #188</a>:
    Fixed an issue where
    <a href="classWt_1_1WTable.html#a0496a46f14f74aed6df4fde8ed161f52">WTable::insertColumn</a>
    would not properly associate the table with the newly created column.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/9923" target="_blank">issue #9923</a>:
    A <a href="classWt_1_1WFileDropWidget.html">WFileDropWidget</a> with
    <a href="classWt_1_1WFileDropWidget.html#a4032057631d756628f27b6546eeaa7bb">setAcceptDrops()</a>
    <code>false</code> and

    <code>true</code> would render the page unresponsive.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/emweb/wt/pull/193" target="_blank">PR #193</a>:
    When the application creator returned a <code>null</code> pointer this would
    cause a null pointer dereference. This was changed to throw an exception, which then
    logs an error and cleanly terminates the session.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/emweb/wt/pull/192" target="_blank">PR #192</a>:
    <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> tags used in
    <code>&lt;head-matter&gt;</code> in <code>wt_config.xml</code> are now
    properly outputted as self-closing tags. This fixes a regression introduced
    in Wt 4.7.0.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/10578" target="_blank">issue #10578</a>:
    Changing the validator of a
    <a href="classWt_1_1WDateEdit.html">WDateEdit</a> would not update the
    <a href="classWt_1_1WDateEdit.html#a9b3a90d5a5e9e5bc766aad3707f61736">bottom()</a> and
    <a href="classWt_1_1WDateEdit.html#a68431831acb72c35f46d30b28e93e2a6">top()</a> of the
    <code>WDateEdit</code> correctly.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Release 4.7.2 (May 12, 2022)</h2>

<p>
  Wt 4.7.2 is a patch release that addresses the following issues:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/10287" target="_blank">Issue #10287</a>:
    wthttp now properly sends close frame back when WebSocket connections are closed.
    Previously, the browser would send a close frame and not get a response back. On Firefox,
    these kinds of errors caused the creation of new WebSocket connections to the same
    endpoint to be delayed by up to one minute, making it seem like the application is hanging.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/10003" target="_blank">Issue #10003</a>:
    Calling <a href="classWt_1_1WApplication.html#a02b9d8aa1b6c2d0dc9edc1b9c63f86dc">WApplication::refresh()</a>
    in the application constructor (e.g. by setting the locale) would produce a JavaScript error if there was
    a <a href="classWt_1_1WSpinBox.html">WSpinBox</a> in the widget tree.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/10320" target="_blank">Issue #10320</a>:
    Version 4.5.2
    (issue <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/9363" target="_blank">#9363</a>) and 4.6.2
    (issue <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/9572" target="_blank">#9572</a>)
    added workarounds to deal with the incorrect formatting of floating point numbers with
    Boost since version 1.76.0. Since Boost 1.79.0 this issue has been fixed, so the workaround
    is now disabled for versions since 1.79.0.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Release 4.7.1 (April 15, 2022)</h2>

<p>
  Wt 4.7.1 is a patch release that addresses the following issues:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/9922" target="_blank">Issue #9922</a>:
    Wt would send an update to the browser on every call to
    <a href="classWt_1_1WApplication.html#a51f50e0641a6d702a7c6ab7f8dd5946a">WApplication::triggerUpdate()</a>
    if server push was enabled.
    This is because Wt thought the state was dirty when its JavaScript response buffer contained only <code>{}</code> (empty
    block). This has been fixed by not sending a response if the buffer contains only <code>{}</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/10177" target="_blank">Issue #10177</a>:
    <code>WT_API</code> was missing from <a href="classWt_1_1Json_1_1TypeException.html">Json::TypeException</a>,
    which meant that its symbols were not exported from dynamic libraries.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/9695" target="_blank">Issue #9695</a>:
    If a <a href="classWt_1_1WSuggestionPopup.html">WSuggestionPopup</a> was created before the dialog it appears in,
    it would be displayed below the dialog. The <code>z-index</code> of
    <code>WSuggestionPopup</code> is now calculated using javascript so it is always shown on top.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Release 4.7.0 (March 11, 2022)</h2>

<p>Wt 4.7.0 is a smaller release with no major new features to speak of, just some improvements and bug fixes here and there.</p>

<h3>Notable changes in default behavior</h3>

<p>These changes affect default behavior in Wt, and may require special attention:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/7434" target="_blank">Issue #7434</a>:
    <a href="classWt_1_1WColor.html#a738c53d744ed38a448d1554f2a2f42cf">WColor::cssText()</a> now outputs
    the color in <code>rgba</code> format by default.
    It is now possible to set the opacity using such functions as
    <a href="classWt_1_1WCssDecorationStyle.html#ac6bd2a8b86c8092fc437329dac09b302">WCssDecorationStyle::setBackgroundColor()</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/8782" target="_blank">Issue #8782</a>:
    When using drag/drop in combination with
    <a href="classWt_1_1WStandardItemModel.html">WStandardItemModel</a>,
    the item flags are now copied. Previously, after dragging an item one time
    the <a href="group__modelview.html#gga1d77c4de293aebfacbdde124de06b8b0a08ab0b568328fb06a466be97d62f5649">ItemFlag::DragEnabled</a>
    flag would be lost and the item would no longer be draggable.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/9591" target="_blank">Issue #9591</a>:
    <a href="https://www.webtoolkit.eu/wt/doc/reference/html/classWt_1_1Http_1_1Request.html#a970b7d266c6bead893ec6334520807bf">
      Http::Request::urlScheme()
    </a> now looks at <code>X-Forwarded-Proto</code> if Wt is behind a trusted reverse proxy.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/9056" target="_blank">Issue #9056</a>:
    There were memory leaks in <a href="classWt_1_1WFileDropWidget.html">WFileDropWidget</a>. This was fixed by changing the class to use
    smart pointers for memory management. As a side effect,
    <a href="classWt_1_1WFileDropWidget.html#a1dbb3d29cfc84797148cd2758d5c0f6b">WFileDropWidget::uploads()</a> now returns a copy instead of a const reference to the internal vector.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Removals</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    Since Google Maps v2 is no longer available as of May 26 2021, Wt no longer supports v2.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Bug fixes</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/9562" target="_blank">Issue #9562</a>:
    <ul>
      <li>If a <a href="classWt_1_1Mail_1_1Message.html">Mail::Message</a> was sent more than once, the attachments would be empty after the first time.</li>
      <li>Mails sent by <a href="namespaceWt_1_1Auth.html">Wt::Auth</a> are now logged using <a href="classWt_1_1WLogger.html">WLogger</a> instead of using <code>std::cout</code>.
        As a result, the logging can also be disabled by adding <code>-info:Auth.AuthService</code> to <code>&lt;log-config&gt;</code> in <code>&lt;wt_config.xml&gt;</code>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/9035" target="_blank">Issue #9035</a>:
    The <code>&lt;head-matter&gt;</code> configuration option did not work with <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> elements without content (e.g. when using the <code>src</code> attribute).
    The parser would always turn this into a self-closing tag, which is not allowed in HTML.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/9271" target="_blank">Issue #9271</a>:
    <a href="classWt_1_1Dbo_1_1backend_1_1MySQL.html">Dbo::backend::MySQL</a> now properly preserves the microsecond part of timestamps.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/9264" target="_blank">Issue #9264</a>:
    Added a remark to <a href="classWt_1_1WAbstractToggleButton.html#ae203379ba84c01935f68cd293f2a3eeb">WAbstractToggleButton::unChecked()</a> to clarify that it is not emitted
    for <a href="classWt_1_1WRadioButton.html">WRadioButtons</a>.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Release 4.6.3 (March 10, 2022)</h2>
<p>
  Wt 4.6.3 is a patch release that addresses the following issues:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/9790" target="_blank">Issue #9790</a>:
    A localized <a href="classWt_1_1WText.html">WText</a> with <a href="namespaceWt.html#a140dea437d52d3d7c438ea3bd16a1480">TextFormat::XHTML</a> was not refreshed properly when using arguments.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Release 4.6.2 (February 15, 2022)</h2>

<p>
  Wt 4.6.2 is a patch release that addresses the following issues:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/9424" target="_blank">Issue #9424</a>:
    The special "no selection" status of
    <a href="classWt_1_1WComboBox.html">WComboBox</a>
    was lost if the items were rerendered, e.g. if the model changed.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/9721" target="_blank">Issue #9721</a>:
    Somewhere during the Bootstrap 5 transition, we accidentally removed some example code (<code>pdfImageWrite.cpp</code>) from the widget gallery.
    We added it back.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/9572" target="_blank">Issue #9572</a>:
    Some JSON serialization tests were temporarily disabled since Boost 1.76.0, since the workaround put
    in place does not generate entirely the same result.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/9571" target="_blank">Issue #9571</a>:
    Provided a fix for a false positive <code>-Wfree-nonheap-object</code> warning in <code>Wt::Signals</code>.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Release 4.6.1 (December 23, 2021)</h2>

<p>
  Wt 4.6.1 is a single bug fix release, fixing a regression
  (<a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/9523" target="_blank">issue #9523</a>).
  A potential null pointer dereference would crash the Wt site or widget gallery every few days.
</p>

<h2>Release 4.6.0 (December 14, 2021)</h2>

<p>
  We know that this one took a bit longer than normal. Starting now we intend to make the Wt release cycle
  more regular, with a release every three months, so we're planning to release Wt 4.7.0 in March 2022.
  We've still been busy improving Wt though. Wt 4.6.0 introduces some major new features, including
  Bootstrap 5 theming support, Dbo-based forms, and SAML support for Wt::Auth.
</p>

<h3>Bootstrap 5 theming support (<a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/7418" target="_blank">issue #7418</a>)</h3>

<p>
  We split up <a href="classWt_1_1WBootstrapTheme.html">WBootstrapTheme</a> into
  <a href="classWt_1_1WBootstrap2Theme.html">WBootstrap2Theme</a> and
  <a href="classWt_1_1WBootstrap3Theme.html">WBootstrap3Theme</a>, and added
  <a href="classWt_1_1WBootstrap5Theme.html">WBootstrap5Theme</a>. We found that the
  different Bootstrap versions were distinct enough to warrant splitting each version of the theme up into its own class.
</p>

<p>
  We abandoned development of <code>WBootstrap4Theme</code>, since there were still some unsolved
  issues with it, and we didn't expect many users to be interested in it.
</p>

<p>
  We also updated the design of the <a href="https://www.webtoolkit.eu/widgets" target="_blank">widget gallery</a>.
  It now uses Bootstrap 5, and no longer uses box layouts, instead opting for a more responsive design featuring
  a collapsible menu on narrow screens. This means that the widget gallery is finally usable on mobile phones!
</p>

<h3>Dbo-based forms (<a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/8622" target="_blank">issue #8622</a>)</h3>

<p>
  We added a new feature that allows Wt to automatically generate a form for a Dbo class. Based on the data types
  that are used by the Dbo class, Wt will generate <a href="classWt_1_1Form_1_1WAbstractFormDelegate.html">form delegates</a>.
  These form delegates are responsible for creating the widget and optional validator for representing the data type in the UI.
  For example:
  <a href="classWt_1_1WString.html">WString</a> objects are by default represented by a
  <a href="classWt_1_1WLineEdit.html">WLineEdit</a>,
  <a href="classWt_1_1WDate.html">WDate</a> objects by
  <a href="classWt_1_1WDateEdit.html">WDateEdit</a>, and so on.
</p>

<p>
  The user is able to override the default behavior either by customizing the
  <a href="classWt_1_1Form_1_1Dbo_1_1FormView.html#aa60100980949a327483cec31c2963420">widgets</a> and/or
  <a href="classWt_1_1Form_1_1Dbo_1_1FormView.html#a55cb4e6750f29a4871686d19cf714042">validators</a> or by creating a new
  form delegate for the specific field and <a href="classWt_1_1Form_1_1Dbo_1_1FormView.html#a42cad48a1c44d319325be1732520ba83">adding</a>
  it to the form.
</p>

<p>
  All classes related to this new feature have been added to a new <a href="namespaceWt_1_1Form.html">Wt::Form</a> namespace.
  Here's a short overview of the most important classes within that namespace:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="classWt_1_1Form_1_1Dbo_1_1FormModel.html">FormModel</a>: a model class that holds the data of the database object.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="classWt_1_1Form_1_1Dbo_1_1FormView.html">FormView</a>: a view class to represent the database object in the UI.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="classWt_1_1Form_1_1WAbstractFormDelegate.html">WAbstractFormDelegate</a>: delegate for creating form widgets.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We also added a new <a href="https://github.com/emweb/wt/tree/master/examples/dbo-form" target="_blank">example</a> to display this new functionality.</p>

<h3>SAML support for Wt::Auth (<a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/8621" target="_blank">issue #8621</a>)</h3>

<p>
  We added SAML support for authentication with third party identity providers.
  <a href="classWt_1_1Auth_1_1Saml_1_1Service.html">Wt::Auth::Saml::Service</a>
  implements a minimal SAML 2.0 service provider for single sign on.
</p>

<p>
  We added a <a href="https://github.com/emweb/wt/tree/master/examples/feature/saml" target="_blank">SAML</a>
  feature example to demonstrate this.
</p>

<p>
  Note: this implementation is based on <a href="https://www.shibboleth.net/" target="_blank">Shibboleth</a>'s
  OpenSAML library. This library uses the Apache License Version 2.0. Due to incompatibility with the GNU General
  Public License V2.0 used by Wt, <strong>a commercial Wt license is required to distribute derived works using SAML
  authentication</strong>.

<h3>Other features and improvements</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    It is now possible to suspend the <a href="classWt_1_1WApplication.html">WApplication</a> using the
    <a href="classWt_1_1WApplication.html#a5c811d91d3999ac881ce87bebaade864">suspend</a> function. Previously,
    logging in using an external authentication provider required a popup, but this can now be done through a redirect
    (<a href="classWt_1_1Auth_1_1OAuthService.html#a72f987f61e7a53636ac3f08b61bee2a5">OAuthService::setPopupEnabled()</a>
    and
    <a href="classWt_1_1Auth_1_1Saml_1_1Service.html#a89ae3fb932497cbe28ed8b032d447966">Saml::Service::setPopupEnabled()</a>).
    This can also be useful for redirecting to payment providers.
    (See <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/7742" target="_blank">issue #7742</a> and
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/9439" target="_blank">issue #9439</a>.)</li>

  <li>
    Added <a href="classWt_1_1WServer.html#a28794f657a950e81c17e2c11fe4270b1">WServer::docRoot()</a>, which allows
    access to the <code>--docroot</code> argument of wthttp.
    (See <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/9391" target="_blank">issue #9391</a>.)
  </li>

  <li>
    The Bootstrap themes now no longer need an active <a href="classWt_1_1WApplication.html">WApplication</a>
    upon construction to properly function, through the addition of an <a href="classWt_1_1WTheme.html#ae15f579e5dfb0d50e909fd5e2c575f60">init()</a> function.
    (See <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/9204" target="_blank">issue #9204</a>.)
  </li>

  <li>The <a href="classWt_1_1WAbstractItemView.html">WAbstractItemView</a> now allows drag/drop in between rows.
    See <a href="classWt_1_1WAbstractItemView.html#a5469c23ea1e9066e98e832ec9da2af21">setEnabledDropLocations()</a>.
    (See <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/8636" target="_blank">issue #8636</a>.)</li>

  <li>With the latest version of Visual Studio supporting std::chrono's date and time zone support it is now possible
    to use it when building Wt in C++20 mode
    (<code>-DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=20 -DWT_CPP20_DATE_TZ_IMPLEMENTATION=std</code>). This means that when Wt is compiled
    this way time zone support just works on Windows like it already did on Linux, instead of requiring you to
    download the IANA time zone database.
    (See <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/8595" target="_blank">issue #8595</a>.)</li>

  <li>Updated the <code>date</code> library to commit <code>fb2554a7e00b24d23838b57a4db4121e148edb5c</code>.</li>

  <li>Ability to change the row header count of <a href="classWt_1_1WTableView.html" target="_blank">WTableView</a>
    after it is rendered (see <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/8077" target="_blank">issue #8077</a>).</li>

  <li>Splitting up updates to stay under the form data limit when many updates are rapidly generated
    (<a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/7990" target="_blank">issue #7990</a>).</li>

  <li>Revert delay of <a href="classWt_1_1WWidget.html#a1ee433705523b2b79c4c3539e0852c92">WWidget::load()</a>.
    Load now happens when a widget is added to the widget tree.
    (See <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/7968" target="_blank">issue #7968</a>.)</li>

  <li>Added option to not automatically select first suggestion of a
    <a href="classWt_1_1WSuggestionPopup.html">WSuggestionPopup</a>.</li>

  <li><a href="classWt_1_1Http_1_1Request.html#ad8a1199b8692854fefb76f494d793f93">Wt::Http::Request::hostName()</a>
    now takes into account <code>X-Forwarded-Host</code>.</li>

  <li>Updated the version of the included <code>SQLite</code> to version 3.35.5.</li>

  <li>Added <code>doc/licenses.md</code> as an exhaustive list of the licenses used by Wt, source code from external
    sources included in Wt and any external dependencies.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Release 4.5.0 (December 15, 2020)</h2>

<h3>Notable changes</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Wt now targets C++14, and <code>CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD</code> defaults to "14". There appears to
      be no good reason to maintain C++11 support, since every compiler that supports enough C++11
      for Wt also supports enough C++14. You should still be able to use C++11 mode when using Wt
      as a library, but Wt itself no longer builds in C++11 mode.</li>
  <li>Wt::Dbo: the <a href="classWt_1_1Dbo_1_1backend_1_1Firebird.html">Firebird</a> backend
    has been marked as unmaintained. The Firebird tests were not succeeding, likely because
    of an incompatibility with the unmaintained IBPP that the Firebird backend is based on
    and recent versions of Firebird.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Features and improvements</h3>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/7586" target="_blank">Issue #7586</a>:
    The <code>&lt;behind-reverse-proxy&gt;</code> option has been deprecated in favor of a new
    <code>&lt;trusted-proxy-config&gt;</code> option. It's now possible to specify the IP header
    that Wt should look for using <code>&lt;remote-ip-header&gt;</code> (defaults to <code>X-Forwarded-For</code>).
    Wt will trust all proxies listed in <code>&lt;trusted-proxies&gt;</code>.
    When <code>&lt;behind-reverse-proxy&gt;</code> is set to <code>true</code>, the behavior stays the
    same as it was before. <a href="overview.html#config_general">See the library overview for more
    information about this option.</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="classWt_1_1WFormModel.html">WFormModel</a> now uses string comparison instead of pointer comparison
    for its fields.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/7666" target="_blank">Issue #7666</a>: In some cases Wt 4.4.0 would
    connect <code>jsScrollVisibilityChanged</code> even if it was not actually being used, causing extra unnecessary
    requests.
  </li>
  <li>
    Added Jenkins pipelines in the
    <code><a href="https://github.com/emweb/wt/tree/master/jenkins" target="_blank">jenkins</a></code> folder.
    We use Jenkins to test Wt at Emweb but we would usually
    keep this configuration in Jenkins. Our pipelines for Linux and FreeBSD have now been updated a bit and moved
    into the Wt repository, since they may be of use to people looking to contribute to Wt.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/7669" target="_blank">Issue #7669</a>: Wt now automatically uses

<h3>Bug fixes</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/6367" target="_blank">Issue #6367</a>:
    fixed issue where wthttp would no longer accept new connections when an error occurred
    while accepting a connection, e.g. if the open file limit was reached.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="classWt_1_1WDate.html#a57a614e3408f39c70605027fe3e3f3f5">WDate::currentServerDate()</a> and

    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/7749" target="_blank">#7749</a>:
    URL parameters were being parsed more than once for file uploads, causing a rapid
    accumulation of duplicate values during uploads, and potentially causing segmentation
    faults. The
    <a href="https://github.com/emweb/wt/tree/master/examples/wtwithqt" target="_blank">wtwithqt</a>
    example was also updated so that it properly waits for condition variables in a loop,
    to deal with spurious wakeups. Also fixed a potential use-after-free when updating resource
    progress.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed an issue where the <a href="classWt_1_1Http_1_1Client.html">HTTP Client</a>
    would wait indefinitely for data when <code>Content-Length</code> is zero.
  </li>
  <li>
    WebSockets: If a bad value for <code>server_max_window_bits</code> or
    <code>client_max_window_bits</code> was encountered, this would cause
    an uncaught exception and a crash. This is now handled properly.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed issue with <code>DISTINCT ON</code> in X3 based query parser: the fields listed
    there would incorrectly be regarded as fields being returned.
  </li>
  <li>

<h2>Release 4.4.0 (August 3, 2020)</h2>

<p>Wt 4.4.0 adds a couple of new features, like multiple X axes, and WColorPicker, among other fixes and tweaks.</p>

<h3>Security related</h3>

<p>
  Wt now rejects GET requests for Ajax-enabled sessions that are not for resources, as an
  extra means to prevent session hijacking attempts. Patch provided by Bruce Toll in
  <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/7585" target="_blank">issue #7585</a>.
</p>

<h3>Major new features</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="classWt_1_1Chart_1_1WCartesianChart.html">WCartesianChart</a>: similar to how
    Wt 4.0.4 added support for multiple Y axes, Wt 4.4.0 adds support for multiple X axes,
    too. Instead of trying to squeeze another <code>int</code> argument into functions like
    <a href="classWt_1_1Chart_1_1WCartesianChart.html#a37b22e4bdc17c45d193848cca443dd28">WCartesianChart::map</a>,
    we decided to add overloads that take two <a href="classWt_1_1Chart_1_1WAxis.html">WAxis</a> references.
  </li>
  <li>
    Added <a href="classWt_1_1WColorPicker.html">WColorPicker</a>: a simple form widget that display a browser-native
    color picker. Patch provided in <a href="https://github.com/emweb/wt/pull/158" target="_blank">PR #158</a>.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Minor features</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    Wt::Dbo:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/emweb/wt/pull/161" target="_blank">PR #161</a>: added support for
        <a href="group__dbo.html#ga4987bb75aacce8ada8662cc86a6fc3b5"><code>ON UPDATE RESTRICT</code></a> and
        <a href="group__dbo.html#gaae0942000fa56b27ca4185f76395c388">ON DELETE RESTRICT</a> foreign key constraints in Wt::Dbo.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>DBO_INSTANTIATE_TEMPLATES</code> and the <code>DBO_EXTERN_TEMPLATES</code> macros used to be disabled with
        Visual Studio since they wouldn't work with old versions of Visual Studio. We reenabled those macros, since
        they've been working for a while now.
      </li>
      <li>
        Added <a href="classWt_1_1Dbo_1_1Query.html#a693ed2ff14acaeffe45b8b6c09b6da8f">orWhere</a>.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="classWt_1_1WFileResource.html">WFileResource</a>: added a log message when failing to open a file. Previously,
    it would not be very clear why nothing was downloaded.
  </li>
  <li>
    Added the MIME type for <code>.txt</code> files to <code>wthttp</code>, so that
    they are displayed in the browser rather than prompt a download.
  </li>
  <li>
    All of the properties that Wt uses are now listed in the default <code>wt_config.xml</code> to make it easier
    to get an overview of all of them without having to find them in the reference documentation.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Updates</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/emweb/wt/pull/162" target="_blank">PR #162</a>: Updated included Bootstrap 3 version to 3.4.1 (from 3.3.7)
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Bug fixes</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    Wt:: Auth:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/7518" target="_blank">Issue #7518</a>: previously, it was
        not possible to set
        <a href="classWt_1_1Auth_1_1AbstractPasswordService_1_1AbstractStrengthValidator.html">AbstractStrengthValidator</a>
        to non-mandatory. This has now been fixed. It now also correctly reports
        <a href="namespaceWt.html#a06744b1cf5fdeae2a8a6c0d0084fdf25">InvalidEmpty</a> when the input is left empty.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fixed an issue where slots connected to <a href="classWt_1_1Auth_1_1Login.html#aafb1d791aeee8b59d28faeda88e8392b">Login::changed()</a> would still have the old session id, which would afterwards be updated, causing resource urls created in the slot to have the wrong session id.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="classWt_1_1WPaintedWidget.html">WPaintedWidget</a>: fixed an issue where combining incremental painting (<a href="namespaceWt.html#a23a1002020ee93ed4679d351b7350de3">PaintFlag::Update</a>) with images could cause the first paint event to be discarded, resulting in an incomplete result.
  </li>
  <li>
    Previously, having multiple instances of <a href="classWt_1_1WGoogleMap.html">WGoogleMap</a> could cause JavaScript errors. This has now been resolved.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Release 4.3.1 (April 20, 2020)</h2>

<p>This release fixes the following issues:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="classWt_1_1WWebWidget.html">WWebWidget:</a> moved <code>id_</code> out of <code>OtherImpl</code>:
    this fixes issues caused by the <code>id_</code> being removed before other things that depend on it,
    like the <code>jsScrollVisibilityChanged_</code> signal. Fixes
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/7508" target="_blank">issue #7508</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed join information not being copied over when copying
    <a href="classWt_1_1Dbo_1_1AbstractQuery.html">Wt::Dbo::AbstractQuery</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    MinGW fixes: Direct2D/DirectWrite were disabled and are now enabled
    by default. Libraries were changed to lowercase for cross-compiling
    from Linux. Windows is case-insensitive, and MinGW libraries on Linux
    are lowercase.
    Fixes <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/7505" target="_blank">issue #7505</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed a wrong documentation link in the widget gallery.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Release 4.3.0 (March 26, 2020)</h2>

<p>Wt 4.3.0 mainly adds the ability to redirect logging to a custom logging function, and login and transport encryption to the mail client, among some other fixes and tweaks.</p>

<h3>Logging redirection (<a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/7240" target="_blank">issue #7240</a>)</h3>

<p>
Before, it was possible to send logging to a file or an <code>std::ostream</code>, and configure which messages were logged in <code>wt_config.xml</code>. Wt 4.3.0 extends
this with the ability to send all logging to a function, allowing users to redirect Wt's logs to whatever logging framework they prefer to use.
</p>

<p>The few log messages coming from Wt::Dbo would always be logged to <code>std::cerr</code>. It is now possible to change this to use Wt's logger, or a custom log function.</p>

<p>To allow for this new functionality, we introduced an abstract <a href="classWt_1_1WLogSink.html">WLogSink</a> class, and the following functions:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="classWt_1_1WServer.html#a45fdbea913a16a310e10e337e5933072">WServer::setCustomLogger()</a>: sets a custom logger on the WServer level</li>
  <li><a href="namespaceWt_1_1Dbo.html#a9a326a13084b93cbb33bf1c470879b0d">Wt::Dbo::setCustomLogger()</a>: sets a custom logger globally for all of Wt::Dbo</li>
  <li><a href="namespaceWt_1_1Dbo.html#ac1c13200d17c21ab7a8dfe4cbf3aed05">Wt::Dbo::logToWt()</a>: sends all of Wt::Dbo's logging to Wt's logger</li>
</ul>

<h3>Mail client: support for login and encryption (<a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/7444" target="_blank">issue #7444</a>)</h3>

<p>
We added basic support for <a href="namespaceWt_1_1Mail.html#a2e673920327e6df099fe3ec0191fdc93a4cd8413207629a963225f4314b53adcd">PLAIN</a> and
<a href="namespaceWt_1_1Mail.html#a2e673920327e6df099fe3ec0191fdc93a99dea78007133396a7b8ed70578ac6ae">LOGIN</a> authentication methods, and
encryption using <a href="namespaceWt_1_1Mail.html#a55d819f240a3553f33e6416ecd05b91fafa91df952500d196f6a10117d98843fe">StartTLS</a> or just
simple <a href="namespaceWt_1_1Mail.html#a55d819f240a3553f33e6416ecd05b91fa099d7d04319e5191b7473e016c55e320">TLS</a>.
</p>

<p>
You can enable authentication with <a href="classWt_1_1Mail_1_1Client.html#a4861b5d0157663d803a3edcb97f651f4">Client::enableAuthentication()</a>, and encryption with
<a href="classWt_1_1Mail_1_1Client.html#a170288f392a84a1e4e560422843c9a74">Client::setTransportEncryption()</a>, or using the configuration properties <code>smtp-auth-username</code>,
  <code>smtp-auth-password</code>, <code>smtp-auth-method</code>, and <code>smtp-transport-encryption</code>.
</p>

<h3>Other changes</h3>

<p>Some small changes in behaviour that you may want to be aware of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Wt::Auth: lost password tokens used to be removed as soon as the link was used, even when they were not actually used to change the password. Now, the
    token will stay valid until the password is actually changed. Also, if the password is changed through other means, the update password token is invalidated.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="classWt_1_1WCanvasPaintDevice.html">WCanvasPaintDevice</a>: instead of stopping the drawing entirely when <code>drawImage()</code> fails (e.g. because of a missing image),
    the image will be skipped but drawing will continue. An error will be logged to the console.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/7060" target="_blank">Issue #7060</a>: fixed
    <a href="classWt_1_1Http_1_1Request.html#a5f18be4100482713c257bea43a3c913b">Request::clientAddress()</a> when behind a reverse proxy to
    be the same as <a href="classWt_1_1WEnvironment.html#aedad4a59684dc41c9985a713ee4eb00a">WEnvironment::clientAddress()</a>, and as mentioned in the documentation.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/7404" target="_blank">Issue #7404</a>: reparenting of popup widgets should only stop at scroll bars.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Other changes and fixes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="classWt_1_1WLength.html">WLength</a>: added
    <a href="namespaceWt.html#a736803866293d189d852d2c7adb7d94ea67bbbcb8c3f0869b19682f3dd5f27893">LengthUnit::ViewportWidth</a>,

    and <a href="namespaceWt.html#a736803866293d189d852d2c7adb7d94ea91b2f19f5c34f05a401200359e38e3c3">LengthUnit::ViewportMax</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Updated the <code>composer</code> and <code>filetreetable</code> examples to use <a href="classWt_1_1WLocalDateTime.html">WLocalDateTime</a> rather than OS specific functions.
  </li>
  <li>
    Refactored the <code>treelist</code> example.
  </li>
  <li>
    Wt::Dbo:
    <ul>
      <li>added query parsing implementation based on X3 instead of Spirit Qi, which reduces compile time and memory usage.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>added <a href="classWt_1_1Dbo_1_1SqlStatement.html#a4868a3639566171ac3d58e15e3bf77f3">SqlStatement::columnCount()</a>. This
        makes it possible to create <code>query_result_traits</code> for result types with a variable number of columns, like <code>std::vector</code>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="classWt_1_1WModelIndex.html">WModelIndex</a> now has a proper ordering, even for raw indexes. This means they can properly be inserted into and retrieved from a
    <code>std::set</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="classWt_1_1WServer.html">WServer</a>: documented the <a href="classWt_1_1WServer.html#a5f850e30f9bd54a946c3f832d60f5b2a">schedule()</a> function.
  </li>
  <li>
    wthttp: added child process id to some of the logging related to dedicated session processes
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Release 4.2.2 (March 16, 2020)</h2>

<p>
  This release fixes the following issues:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Security-related: in Wt::Auth the lost password email would be sent to the email
    address provided in the form, rather than the user's configured email address. While
    we treat email addresses as case insensitive, it is possible that the mail server may not,
    and that could potentially be used to steal an account. It is however quite rare for
    email services to be case sensitive.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/7439" target="_blank">Issue #7439</a>:
    ensure that tooltips are always on top, even inside of a dialog.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/7448" target="_blank">Issue #7448</a>:
    fixed compilation error on recent versions of MinGW, by using the <code>gmtime_s</code>
    function on Windows.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/7447" target="_blank">Issue #7447</a>:
    fixed text format being reset when the text of a <a href="classWt_1_1WAnchor.html">WAnchor</a> is cleared.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fix for <a href="classWt_1_1WLeafletMap.html">WLeafletMap</a> issue that was <a href="https://redmine.emweb.be/boards/2/topics/16718" target="_blank">reported on the forum</a>: signals would get unexposed when options were changed.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/7457" target="_blank">Issue #7457</a>:
    moved call to <a href="classWt_1_1WApplication.html#ae88546224ed32cade783da188b145138">WApplication::require()</a> to the constructor, since calling it in the render function may cause issues.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixes for <a href="classWt_1_1WVirtualImage.html">WVirtualImage</a>:
    <ul>
      <li>Do not render zero width or zero height images. This was possible when <code>imageWidth</code> or <code>imageHeight</code> was
        a multiple of the <code>gridImageSize</code>.</li>
      <li>Fixed <a href="classWt_1_1WVirtualImage.html#a0feb746fc22b907f779423bd9768109c">scrollTo()</a> when the image is narrower than the viewport: <code>scrollTo(0, 0)</code> would not put <code>(0, 0)</code> at
        the top left when the image was narrower (or taller) than the viewport.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/7480" target="_blank">Issue #7480</a>: prefix Wt's crypt functions to fix issues
    when linking with <code>libxcrypt</code>, and also set C code's default visibility to hidden.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/7468" target="_blank">Issue #7468</a>: fixed panning not working properly for a <a href="classWt_1_1Chart_1_1WCartesianChart.html">WCartesianChart</a> with plain tooltips.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/7482" target="_blank">Issue #7482</a>: <code>lastId_</code> in Postgres backend should be <code>long long</code>.
  </li>
  <li>

    <b>CMake fixes:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>wt-config.cmake</code>: CMake would look for Boost even when Wt was linked dynamically, and
        Boost was linked statically, like in our Windows builds.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>wt-config-version.cmake</code>: <code>match</code> function needed to be <code>math</code>
      </li>
      <li>
        CMake needed to look for <code>Boost::filesystem</code> for some examples (but didn't).
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  If you diff this release with the last one, it looks like we've changed a lot more, but this
  is simply because we needed to update Emweb bvba to Emweb bv everywhere.
</p>

<h2>Release 4.2.0 (December 3, 2019)</h2>

<p>
Wt 4.2.0 introduces no major new features, but comes with some nice fixes and little quality of life improvements.
</p>

<h3>Notable backwards-incompatible changes</h3>
<ul>
  <li><a href="classWt_1_1WSuggestionPopup.html">WSuggestionPopup</a>: <a href="structWt_1_1WSuggestionPopup_1_1Options.html#a3e29211108f2b156a0b983a5a15ecece">wordSeparators</a> no longer requires (extra) escaping, so a newline is indicated with the string literal "\n", not "\\n". Similarly, the <a href="structWt_1_1WSuggestionPopup_1_1Options.html#aef3e98b66b4cc136e2c726079d6681de">whitespace</a> property was incorrectly documented as requiring (extra) escaping.</li>
  <li>The <a href="classWt_1_1WLogEntry.html">WLogEntry</a> copy constructor&ndash;which logically performed a move&ndash;was removed and replaced by a move constructor.</li>
  <li>Removed <code>WDatePicker::setGlobalPopup</code>&ndash;it was deprecated in Wt 3.3.0, but we forgot to remove it in Wt 4.</li>
  <li><a href="classWt_1_1WLogger.html">WLogger</a> now logs opening of log file to the previous output (usually <code>std::cerr</code>) using the logger instead of directly to <code>std::cerr</code>. This allows to disable this log message with <code>-info:WLogger</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>CMake changes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    When using GCC and clang, the default visibility of symbols is now set to hidden. This limits the exported symbols to only Wt's public interfaces,
    reducing the size of <code>.so</code> files and preventing accidental use of unexposed APIs.
  </li>
  <li>
    Added Wt version information to Wt's CMake config files
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>HTTP connector</h3>
  <p>It's now possible to get client certificate information in wthttp when behind a reverse proxy, see the documentation for <a href="classWt_1_1WEnvironment.html#a04b65c4f7fe6e3b0bd652e2580b4f62e">WEnvironment::sslInfo()</a> for more information.</p>
  <p>This is tested to work with nginx and Apache. HAProxy is currently not supported, since its variables are in a rather different format.</p>
  <p>Wt can still use this info even if Wt itself is compiled without OpenSSL.</p>
<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    PR <a href="https://github.com/emweb/wt/pull/140">#140</a>: <a href="classWt_1_1WLogEntry.html">WLogEntry</a> can now use argument dependent lookup for <code>to_string</code> in its <code>operator&lt;&lt;</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Added overloads to <a href="classWt_1_1WServer.html#af2100c604f1ad933256097972fd38102">WRun()</a>,
    <a href="classWt_1_1WServer.html#af22c4176fb07d6f5f3cab42ef7f36f7f">WServer::WServer()</a>,
    <a href="classWt_1_1WServer.html#a6ef2c780a70eebc68707ea0d684b8509">WServer::setServerConfiguration()</a>,
    and <a href="classWt_1_1WServer.html#afd4dc8802de5f9b93b23ea7948c8a91e">WServer::restart()</a> that
    take an applicationPath <code>std::string</code>, and a vector of strings for arguments, instead of <code>argc</code>, and <code>argv</code>.
    This is more convenient if the command line arguments are generated by the application.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="classWt_1_1WTreeView.html">WTreeView</a>: added <a href="classWt_1_1WTreeView.html#ab7c527ce5304cdbe7f5bcb3e51880641">collapseAll()</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Issue <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/7307" target="_blank">#7307</a>: enabled top and bottom padding on a non-inline <a href="classWt_1_1WText.html">WText</a>.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Limited prevention of default action of the <code>dragstart</code> event to only draggable widgets. This used to be global (set on <code>document.body</code>), but could conflict with other JavaScript libraries, especially when Wt is used in WidgetSet mode.
  </li>
  <li>
    Issue <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/7210" target="_blank">#7210</a>: fixed removal of all widgets in a layout causing a JavaScript error
  </li>
  <li>
    Fix for PR <a href="https://github.com/emweb/wt/pull/145">#145</a>: fixed linking error on Windows (unresolved external symbol "public: static struct Wt::NoClass Wt::NoClass::none")
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="classWt_1_1WPainter.html">WPainter</a>: fixed arc drawing code to be consistent across different backends, and with Qt's QPainter. Its behavior used to be erratic when angles larger than 360 degrees or lower than 0 were used.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="classWt_1_1WPdfImage.html">WPdfImage</a>: fixed double scaling of pen width (e.g. a pen of width 4 pixels, and a scaling factor of 2 would result in a 16 pixel wide pen instead of an 8 pixel wide pen).
  </li>
  <li>
    Many documentation tweaks and fixes that were discovered when working on JWt 4.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed issue <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/7139" target="_blank">#7139</a>: some widgets would fail to be correctly reparented.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed issue <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/7336" target="_blank">#7336</a>: Wt was touching the history API every 10 ms when scrolling to store the scroll position, causing sluggishness, especially on mobile browsers with smooth scrolling. The scroll position is now saved after the user has stopped scrolling.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed issue <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/7323" target="_blank">#7323</a>: updated the <a href="https://github.com/emweb/wt/tree/master/examples/feature/broadcast" target="_blank">broadcast</a> feature example: its use of <code>bindSafe()</code> was incorrect
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Release 4.1.2 (October 30, 2019)</h2>
<p>
  This release fixes the following issues:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>wthttp security issues</b>:
    <ul>
      <li>Wt internally used an <code>SSL-Client-Certificates</code> header to send client certificates to child processes when using dedicated process mode. It was however <i>always accepted even when Wt was not behind a reverse proxy</i>, and sent to child processes as-is. <code>wthttp</code> now correctly disregards it when not received from a reverse proxy. The header was also renamed to <code>X-Wt-Ssl-Client-Certificates</code> to clarify that it is a non-standard internal Wt header.</li>
      <li>When using dedicated session processes with wthttp, the parent process would trust <code>X-Forwarded-Proto</code> and <code>X-Forwarded-Port</code> even when Wt was not configured to be behind a reverse proxy. These are now discarded.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/boards/2/topics/16551" target="_blank">an issue raised on the forum</a> causing <code>WTreeView</code> to not properly react to certain size changes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/7291" target="_blank">issue #7291</a>: wtfcgi would not properly match default entry point
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed a few issues found by clang-analyzer:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Fixed an issue in <a href="classWt_1_1WAnchor.html">WAnchor</a> that would cause <code>image()</code> to return <code>nullptr</code> if it was provided in the constructor.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fixed <a href="classWt_1_1WCssDecorationStyle.html">WCssDecorationStyle</a> self-assignment
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Made tests succeed even if Wt is built with <code>ENABLE_UNWIND=ON</code>.
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/7292" target="_blank">issue #7292</a>: <a href="classWt_1_1Auth_1_1OAuthService.html">OAuthService</a> now correctly uses <code>refresh_token</code> instead of <code>refreshToken</code></li>
  <li><a href="classWt_1_1Http_1_1Client.html">Http::Client</a> fixes:
    <ul>
      <li>fixed <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/7272" target="_blank">issue #7272</a>: support <code>@</code> character in the path of a URL</li>
      <li>fixed 204 No Content response code behavior (would hang before, waiting for content) (<a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/7273" target="_blank">issue #7273</a>)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>More informative error and exception messages:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="classWt_1_1Dbo_1_1QueryModel.html"><code>QueryModel</code></a>'s "geometry inconsistent with database" exception now contains row and cache start and size information</li>
      <li><code>WebSession</code>'s "not serving this" info message contains more context so it's less confusing</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Documentation fixes:
    <ul>
      <li>The release notes for Wt 3.3.8 incorrectly referred to <code>allowed-hosts</code>, while this property is actually named <code>allowed-origins</code></li>
      <li>Updated <a href="classWt_1_1WLocale.html#a5b1961702289e8dc6f9e2c293f9f8aa5">WLocale::setTimeZone()</a> documentation</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<h2>Release 4.1.1 (September 9, 2019)</h2>
<p>
  This release fixes the following issues:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed horizontal scrolling stutter on mobile browsers in <code>WTableView</code></li>
  <li>Fixed <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/7000" target="_blank">issue #7000</a>: possible out of bounds access in <code>WTableView::itemWidget()</code></li>
  <li>Fixed <code>valueChanged()</code> documentation of <code>WSpinBox</code> and <code>WDoubleSpinBox</code></li>
  <li>Fixed <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/7164" target="_blank">issue #7164</a>: Added missing <code>&lt;stdexcept&gt;</code> include to <code>observing_ptr_impl.hpp</code></li>
  <li>Fixed <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/7167" target="_blank">issue #7167</a>: configure SSL context when using <code>--https-listen</code> too (not just when using <code>--https-address</code>/<code>--https-port</code></li>
  <li>Fixed <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/7187" target="_blank">issue #7187</a>: contents of <code>WTabWidget</code> did not properly stretch in height</li>
  <li>Fixed <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/7193" target="_blank">issue #7193</a>: compatibility with Pango 1.44: added harfbuzz include dir</li>
  <li>Fixed <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/7195" target="_blank">issue #7195</a>: contents of <code>WStackedWidget</code> would not properly respond to window size change</li>
  <li>Fixed <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/7206" target="_blank">issue #7206</a>: added mention in Wt 4.0.0 release notes that <code>setObjectName()</code> does not change a widget's <code>id</code> anymore. It is now in an extra attribute called <code>data-object-name</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Release 4.1.0 (July 31, 2019)</h2>
<p>
  This is the first release to change the versioning scheme to be more aligned with semantic versioning.
  From now on, the last number is reserved for patches (i.e. important bug fixes), not extra features, as long as
  those bug fixes don't require major changes. Patches will be released up until the next minor version bump.
</p>
<p>
  From now on, a 4.1-release branch will track any bug fixes, while the master branch will become the next release (in this case 4.2.0)
</p>
<p>
  We won't completely ban small API-breaking changes from the minor version, but we will as always avoid them as best as we can.
</p>
<p>
  This also does <em>not</em> mean that Wt will now have a stable ABI. You will always have to recompile in order to do
  a minor version upgrade of Wt. Wt has never had a stable ABI, and that isn't going to change.
</p>
<p>
  Apart from that, this release features one new widget (<a href="classWt_1_1WLeafletMap.html">WLeafletMap</a>) and many little tweaks, features, and bug fixes.
</p>
<h3>Notable backwards-incompatible changes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Extensionless headers (e.g. <code>#include &lt;Wt/WApplication&gt;</code> instead of <code>#include &lt;Wt/WApplication.h&gt;</code>) have
      been deprecated since Wt 4.0.0. These headers were now removed. Use the script <code>migrate/wt4_add_h_to_includes.py</code> if you
      want to automate the rewriting of extensionless headers.</li>
  <li>When using the GraphicsMagick implementation of <a href="classWt_1_1WRasterImage.html">WRasterImage</a>, the rendering to
      raster image is now done in <a href="classWt_1_1WPaintDevice.html#a75827be2076716985533dbc75dfdc512">done()</a> instead of <a href="classWt_1_1WResource.html#a3a740f8cc29e2e6e4e58defc9c88b8b6">handleRequest()</a>.
      You were always supposed to destroy your instance of <a href="classWt_1_1WPainter.html">WPainter</a>, or call <a href="classWt_1_1WPainter.html#a50beb0c8cb77c12e2dee807e4fe4bcb4">WPainter::end()</a>
      before e.g. using <a href="classWt_1_1WResource.html#ad8bbe65a888cc43e0d356f18509b9a0f">write()</a>, but Wt used to be rather forgiving&mdash;it would just work.
      If you are getting empty images after updating, this would likely be the reason.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="classWt_1_1WApplication_1_1UpdateLock.html#a09011389bb0b9319acbcd32800852918">WApplication::UpdateLock::operator bool()</a> and
    <a href="classWt_1_1Core_1_1observing__ptr.html#a93ae9f0dd2a1553dc081faad7e1078ee">observing_ptr::operator bool()</a> were made <code>explicit</code>,
    so they will no longer implicitly convert to <code>bool</code>, only
    <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/implicit_conversion#Contextual_conversions" target="_blank">contextually</a>.
    This may cause some valid code to no longer compile, but it is more likely that it will actually uncover bugs.
  </li>
  <li>
    The default z-index of <a href="classWt_1_1WPopupWidget.html">WPopupWidget</a> was changed to 1100 instead of 100, since 1000
    is the highest z-index used by Leaflet. This is generally considered an implementation detail, but if you have written any custom
    CSS that sets the z-index, then you may have to update this CSS.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>New widgets</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="classWt_1_1WLeafletMap.html">WLeafletMap</a>: this is a wrapper around the <a href="https://leafletjs.com/" target="_blank">Leaflet</a>
         JavaScript library. It has support for some basic features of Leaflet, and one special feature: the ability to add arbitrary
         widgets (within reason) as markers to the map using <a href="classWt_1_1WLeafletMap_1_1WidgetMarker.html">WidgetMarker</a>.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>New examples</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Added a <a href="classWt_1_1WLeafletMap.html">WLeafletMap</a> example to the <a href="https://www.webtoolkit.eu/widgets/graphics-charts/leaflet-maps" target="_blank">widget gallery</a>
    and in <code>examples/leaflet</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Added an <a href="classWt_1_1Http_1_1Client.html">Http::Client</a> example in <code>examples/http-client</code>.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>CMake changes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Wt now uses CMake's included FindOpenSSL, FindZLIB and FindPNG modules instead of its own.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>WT_CPP17_ANY_IMPLEMENTATION</code> is now set to <code>any</code> by default when <code>CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD</code> is set to
    17 or higher, i.e. it defaults to <code>std::any</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Removed the "vintage" method of finding Boost, because it has been obsolete for a long time already.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed building with Boost 1.70 when using Boost's included package configuration files for CMake.
  </li>
  <li>
    Made the <code>wtwithqt</code> example build with Qt 5 too, not just with Qt 4.
  </li>
  <li>
    Made sure we can properly build <code>wtdbomysql</code> with a static MariaDB client library on Windows.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Auth</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Added <a href="classWt_1_1Auth_1_1AuthService.html#aee229af97b12975d00e7448e486f9cb2">AuthService::setAuthTokenUpdateEnabled()</a>. Previously, when using the
    remember me functionality the auth token (remember me cookie) would be changed. When accessing the application from two tabs at the same time, however, or when
    refreshing quickly, this could cause the session to be logged out: the auth token has changed, but the client still uses the old one. This is still the default
    behavior, but you can disable it by using <code>setAuthTokenUpdateEnabled(false)</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed a use-after-free issue when <a href="classWt_1_1Auth_1_1Login.html#aafb1d791aeee8b59d28faeda88e8392b">Auth::Login::changed()</a> is connected to a slot that
    removes the <a href="classWt_1_1Auth_1_1AuthWidget.html">AuthWidget</a>.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Dbo</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Added <a href="classWt_1_1Dbo_1_1AbstractQuery.html">AbstractQuery</a>, an abstract base class of <a href="classWt_1_1Dbo_1_1Query.html">Query</a>,
    to facilitate the dynamic generation of queries.
  </li>
  <li>
    Added <a href="classWt_1_1Dbo_1_1Query.html#a3e76ffc9857381684303d46457399701">Query::join()</a>,
    <a href="classWt_1_1Dbo_1_1Query.html#aeee3f10d74361e49cce4dc049f0bdc0b">Query::leftJoin()</a>,
    and <a href="classWt_1_1Dbo_1_1Query.html#a1dd4a3461a4d99377dee24227325c63c">Query::rightJoin()</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Added support for <code>std::optional</code> when using C++ &ge; 17.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>std::chrono::time_point</code> and <code>std::chrono::duration</code> were treated as nullable, while they should be non-nullable, since they have
    no reasonable "null" value. Use <code>std::optional</code> or <code>boost::optional</code> to make them nullable instead.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed a query corruption bug when using <code>UNION</code>, <code>INTERSECT</code>, or <code>EXCEPT</code> (<a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/7028" target="_blank">issue #7028</a>).
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed a crash when using <code>Session::dropTables()</code> while there is an active transaction, <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/boards/2/topics/16123" target="_blank">as reported on the forum</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    PostgreSQL uses <code>?</code> for some operators, but that is also the character we use for placeholders in prepared statements. If the literal <code>?</code> is meant instead of a placeholder, you can now use <code>??</code>. This is similar to how PostgreSQL's JDBC driver handles it.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Miscellaneous features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    wthttp: <code>--deploy-path</code> is now prepended to <a href="classWt_1_1WServer.html#a84f84652ccb139850adcf5ea75f50fa5">entry points</a> and <a href="classWt_1_1WServer.html#a7b78b5e35d2dc3086faa54f82124cf38">static resources</a> when they don't start with a forward slash (<code>/</code>). Omitting the slash used to be an error.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="classWt_1_1Chart_1_1WCartesian3DChart.html">WCartesian3DChart</a>: added <a href="classWt_1_1Chart_1_1WCartesian3DChart.html#ac097e1922b519592a6b3732f3e8b8119">setAxis()</a>, allowing custom <code>WAxis</code> implementations e.g. axes with <a href="classWt_1_1Chart_1_1WAxis.html#a7a6e079a7a0b136f77dad65b2c1abcc1">custom labels and ticks</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Added <a href="classWt_1_1ItemDataRole.html#af593515a1cc8e972679cc00e362db4ce">ItemDataRole::MarkerType</a>, to change the <a href="group__charts.html#ga9f38f3460fb2575d5f4f1a1ac51a7db6">MarkerType</a> of individual data points on a <a href="classWt_1_1Chart_1_1WCartesianChart.html">2D chart</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="classWt_1_1Http_1_1Client.html">Http::Client</a>:
    <ul>
      <li>
        added <a href="classWt_1_1Http_1_1Client.html#a28336ba9677e6e3cc6c890f490f2965a">HEAD request</a> support
      </li>
      <li>
        On Windows: uses Windows root certificates. It is no longer necessary to provide a <a href="classWt_1_1Http_1_1Client.html#a7c9fbf7fc9f671519b0652f3bbe38521">path</a> with certificates for validation (or worse, disable verification altogether) when using TLS to talk to a server that uses a certificate issued by a CA that is trusted by Windows. Now the <code>Http::Client</code> will generally just work with <code>https</code> sites on Windows, just like it did on Linux. This also fixes other parts of Wt that use <code>Http::Client</code>, like <a href="classWt_1_1Payment_1_1PayPalService.html">PayPalService</a> and <a href="classWt_1_1Auth_1_1OAuthService.html">OAuthService</a>.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="classWt_1_1WWidget.html#a1f5151154770b4956b4870cb4ecc38d3">removeWidget()</a> and <a href="classWt_1_1WObject.html#a00f32a263b742f42b73a9353eaa3c7ca">removeChild()</a> now return a more concrete <code>std::unique_ptr</code>, for convenience. Also added a similar <a href="classWt_1_1WFitLayout.html#a071ea55ea16e71213b3bbd2f5f497932">WFitLayout::addWidget()</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Wt's widget coordinate calculation code now uses <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/getBoundingClientRect" target="_blank">getBoundingClientRect()</a>, which means that coordinate calculations are still accurate even when CSS transforms are used to position widgets. This was necessary for <a href="classWt_1_1WLeafletMap_1_1WidgetMarker.html">WidgetMarker</a> support.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="classWt_1_1WTemplate.html">WTemplate</a>'s <a href="structWt_1_1WTemplate_1_1Functions.html#ab070ae026639fb7edc0c70db6510abc7">while_f</a> function now takes extra arguments, similar to the <a href="structWt_1_1WTemplate_1_1Functions.html#a734f46b7a8155cbc6cf0407dd3dbe85d">block</a> function.
  </li>
  <li>
    Added <a href="classWt_1_1WResource.html#a6695dad28a25c7cbfef93c371e7c5a1e">WResource::setTakesUpdateLock()</a> as a way to make a (non-static) resource grab the <a href="classWt_1_1WApplication.html">WApplication</a>'s <a href="classWt_1_1WApplication_1_1UpdateLock.html">UpdateLock</a> before <a href="classWt_1_1WResource.html#a3a740f8cc29e2e6e4e58defc9c88b8b6">handleRequest()</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Made it possible to set a <a href="classWt_1_1WTableView.html#afc65ef8675ae2d53300eaa511c1fad6b">preload margin</a> on <code>WTableView</code>. This
    allows to customize how much of the table's contents should be loaded. Higher preload margin means fewer but larger updates of the table's contents
    when scrolling.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Miscellaneous bug fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed an issue where JavaScript could be sent to the browser in the wrong order when doing background updates of hidden widgets
    (<a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/7023" target="_blank">issue #7023</a>)</li>
  <li>Fixed a client side memory leak caused by misuse of jQuery's data feature (<a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/boards/2/topics/15941" target="_blank">reported on the forums</a>)</li>
  <li><a href="classWt_1_1WTableView.html">WTableView</a>: fixed row deletion behavior</li>
  <li>Fixed icons not showing up on tabs and menu items when using <a href="classWt_1_1WBootstrapTheme.html">WBootstrapTheme</a>, as <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/boards/1/topics/15664" target="_blank">reported on the forums</a>.</li>
  <li>Fixed wrong <a href="classWt_1_1WStackedWidget.html">WStackedWidget</a> height when animating transitions (<a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/6788" target="_blank">issue #6788</a>)</li>
  <li>Fixed not able to hide widgets with a flexbox-based layout (<a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/6884" target="_blank">issue #6884</a>)</li>
  <li>Fixed out of bounds array access when using a widget with a custom HTML tag name (<a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/7059" target="_blank">issue #7059</a>). Widgets will now derive whether they are default inline based on the widget's default DOM element type.</li>
  <li>Fixed a regression in <a href="classWt_1_1WDate.html#a6d604c9c4409729abbe4a334c4d69368">WDate::addMonths()</a> and <a href="classWt_1_1WDate.html#ab03f57a16749501343b8368047199002">addYears()</a>, introduced in Wt 4.0.0. When a day would not exist in the resulting month, this would yield an invalid month. Instead, it will now (as it did in Wt 3) set the date to the last day of that month, e.g. May 31, 2019 + 6 months becomes November 30, 2019.</li>
  <li>Fixed an issue where mouse signals of a <a href="classWt_1_1WTreeView.html">WTreeView</a> would fire multiple times (<a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/6260" target="_blank">issue #6260</a>)</li>
  <li>
    wthttp WebSocket fixes:
    <ul>
      <li>
        WebSocket requests for non-existent sessions (often the result of restarting the server) no longer create a new bogus session.
      </li>
      <li>
        WebSocket messages with continuation frames (as sent by Google Chrome when the messages become very large) could become corrupted,
        especially when per-message-deflate is used (<a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/7039" target="_blank">issue #7039</a>,
        <a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/7034" target="_blank">#7034</a>).
      </li>
      <li>
        WebSocket message size is now properly limited by <code>--max-memory-request-size</code>. Previously, this would only limit the size
        of individual frames, not the entire message.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fixed a possible use-after-free or double delete issue when an invalid WebSocket message was received.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed undefined <code>ackId</code> overflow behavior (which could very rarely cause a session to fail)
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="classWt_1_1WContainerWidget.html#a60e57a8860785d6b587a36b616cb5e12">WContainerWidget::setLayout()</a> now properly clears any existing contents of the container.
    This would previously cause JavaScript errors (<a href="https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/7128">issue #7128</a>).
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Release 4.0.5 (December 14, 2018)</h2>
<p>Wt 4.0.5 is almost entirely a bugfix release. Here are the key changes:</p>

<h3>Minor API breaking changes</h3>

<h4>ItemDataRole</h4>
<p>One of the things we changed in Wt 4 is the type of roles in the
<a href="group__modelview.html">MVC system</a>. They are no longer
represented by an enum, but now through a
<a href="classWt_1_1ItemDataRole.html">class that's a thin wrapper
around an int</a>. We however forgot to update the role's type in
a few places, and this release rectifies that. The following methods
have been updated:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="classWt_1_1WIdentityProxyModel.html#acfa2c2b201f8919e462e1a2d498b75ab">WIdentityProxyModel::setHeaderData()</a></li>
  <li><a href="classWt_1_1WSuggestionPopup.html#a0abf89a25ea7eece7d36391d56130cf7">WSuggestionPopup::setEditRole()</a></li>
  <li><a href="classWt_1_1WSuggestionPopup.html#acba647adde23e76f2ce5446b60145aa0">WSuggestionPopup::editRole()</a></li>
</ul>

<h4>Wt::Auth::UpdatePasswordWidget</h4>
<p>The <a href="classWt_1_1Auth_1_1UpdatePasswordWidget.html">UpdatePasswordWidget</a>,
part of the authentication subsystem of Wt, would delete itself when done.
This was harmless when it was inside of a <a href="classWt_1_1WDialog.html">WDialog</a>, but it's less practical when
used elsewhere. We've changed the behavior of <code>UpdatePasswordWidget</code> to emit the
<a href="classWt_1_1Auth_1_1UpdatePasswordWidget.html#a6c6bedf0628488cbb09d44c6df441004">updated()</a> and
<a href="classWt_1_1Auth_1_1UpdatePasswordWidget.html#a640d20893579fcc2642ac62f0a550b6a">canceled()</a>
signals instead.</p>

<h3>Dbo: reentrant statement use</h3>
<p>For the longest time, the Dbo tutorial has mentioned that
&ldquo;you need to be careful to not have two collections with the same statement busy at the same time&rdquo;.
If you did attempt concurrent use of statements, an exception mentioned that
&ldquo;Reentrant statement use is not yet implemented&rdquo;. Starting from
Wt 4.0.5, you won't see that error anymore. Dbo will now
clone the prepared statement as needed.</p>

<h3>Flex layout fixes</h3>
One of Wt 4's niceties is the fact that the layout managers now rely less on JavaScript, but employ flexbox instead. This
did not work perfectly, though, so it was still possible to switch the implementation to the old JavaScript method if things
did not work correctly. We fixed many issues in the flex layout implementation, and now the widget gallery works
correctly using flexbox (pending an overhaul to make the widget gallery more responsive and more in line with the Wt homepage theme).

<h2>Release 4.0.4 (August 22, 2018)</h2>
<p>This release brings with it the usual bugfixes, but also some new features:</p>

<h3>WCartesianChart improvements</h3>

<h4>Multiple Y axis support</h4>

<p>In previous versions of Wt, it was already possible to have two separate Y axes. This release
allows for any amount of Y axes, and extends the interactive functionality to support multiple Y axes.</p>

<p>The following methods have been added:</p>

    </ul>
  </dd>
</dl>

<p>It's also possible to pan and zoom individual axes by scrolling on or dragging the axis itself, or by touch dragging and pinching.</p>

<h4>On-demand loading</h4>

<p>We've added on-demand loading functionality to <a href="classWt_1_1Chart_1_1WCartesianChart.html"><code>WCartesianChart</code></a>. Enable on-demand loading when you have a lot of data and/or need the ability to zoom in very far. This will make it so that only the data for the visible X range is loaded, and will improve performance of data series with large amounts data. This becomes especially useful in combination with the ability to set a maximum zoom range, so that you can't zoom all the way out to see all data.</p>

<p>The following methods have been added:</p>

<dl>
  <dt><a href="classWt_1_1Chart_1_1WCartesianChart.html"><code>WCartesianChart</code></a></dt>
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="classWt_1_1Chart_1_1WCartesianChart.html#a97f7f38a9f751b0b41d67f4546cc32f9"><code>void setOnDemandLoadingEnabled(bool enabled)</code></a></li>
      <li><a href="classWt_1_1Chart_1_1WCartesianChart.html#a2380aeb17e103bae1f332fd4c56d6b2b"><code>bool onDemandLoadingEnabled() const</code></a></li>
      <li><a href="classWt_1_1Chart_1_1WCartesianChart.html#a9072e157f556bd8eea1eef14426d4f29"><code>void setLoadingBackground(const WBrush &amp;brush)</code></a></li>
      <li><a href="classWt_1_1Chart_1_1WCartesianChart.html#a3e33918e5cbee75d172ab820e71f69bc"><code>const WBrush&amp; loadingBackground() const</code></a></li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
  <dt><a href="classWt_1_1Chart_1_1WAxis.html"><code>WAxis</code></a></dt>
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="classWt_1_1Chart_1_1WAxis.html#ada743ccf44212cfb1f4a6fa83b79e581"><code>void setMaximumZoomRange(double size)</code></a></li>
      <li><a href="classWt_1_1Chart_1_1WAxis.html#a10742d531e8141474ea707d3c4730386"><code>double maximumZoomRange() const</code></a></li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
</dl>

<p>Note that the data must be ordered on X axis value for this feature to work properly.</p>

<h3>Path parameters</h3>

<p>It's now possible to use variables in <a href="classWt_1_1WServer.html#a7b78b5e35d2dc3086faa54f82124cf38"><code>WServer::addResource()</code></a>, e.g. <code>server.addResource(&amp;resource, &quot;/users/${user}&quot;)</code>.</p>

<p>These parameters are then accessible in the <code>WResource</code>'s <code>handleRequest()</code> function through
<a href="classWt_1_1Http_1_1Request.html#af6917bd5182e9a33f74e3e7191899495"><code>Http::Request::urlParams()</code></a>
and <a href="classWt_1_1Http_1_1Request.html#a0100186e6bc33bd221e25799e2059f7d"><code>Http::Request::urlParam(const std::string&amp;)</code></a>.</p>

<p>A feature example demonstrating this was added in <code>examples/feature/urlparams</code>.</p>

<h3>Idle timeout</h3>

<p>Added an <code>&lt;idle-timeout&gt;</code> option to the configuration (<code>wt_config.xml</code>). If set,
<a href="classWt_1_1WApplication.html#a4e8020fca24d09661ee4bf13400354d9"><code>WApplication::idleTimeout()</code></a> will be triggered after the configured number of seconds.</p>

<p>This is intended to prevent unauthorized people from using an active session from a
device that's been abandoned by the user.</p>

<a href="classWt_1_1WFileDropWidget.html"><h3>WFileDropWidget</h3></a>

<p>Added the ability to set a
<a href="classWt_1_1WFileDropWidget.html#a9ad41a8986a7bbb25178e0cda850333d">JavaScript filter</a>, e.g. to
compress uploads client side.

<h3>Miscellaneous improvements</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Added support for transparency in PDFs</li>
  <li>Rudimentary support for drawing SVGs on HTML canvas with <code>WPainter::drawImage</code></li>
  <li>
    <a href="classWt_1_1Dbo_1_1backend_1_1MySQL.html"><code>Wt::Dbo::backend::MySQL</code></a>:
    Fixed compatibility with MySQL Connector/C 8.0 and MariaDB Connector/C 3.0
  </li>
  <li>
    Added <a href="classWt_1_1WEnvironment.html#ad2846f6fd581cd6c8c6933eff0e5fa73"><code>WEnvironment::timeZoneName()</code></a>
  </li>
  <li>
    Added <code>insertTab</code>, <code>itemAt</code> and <code>currentItem</code> to
    <a href="classWt_1_1WTabWidget.html"><code>WTabWidget</code></a>
  </li>
  <li>
    Disabled TLS v. 1.0 and 1.1 support
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Release 4.0.3 (April 12, 2018)</h2>
<p>This release fixes compatibility with Boost 1.66, fixes some bugs, and adds
some functionality:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>WFileUpload: added display widget</dt>
  <dd>Often, native file upload field look out of place in the rest of a web application's design.
      A common trick is to hide the file upload field, and add another widget that forwards its click
      signal to the file upload field. We added
      <a href="classWt_1_1WFileUpload.html#ab95ec35db690296e848d89a71c23737a">setDisplayWidget()</a>
      to make it easy to implement that trick.</dd>
  <dt>WFileDropWidget: added drop indication and global drop</dt>
  <dd>When <a href="classWt_1_1WFileDropWidget.html#a0c1400a6f7f63eec4bb1cfe30807538e">drop indication</a>
  is enabled, a WFileDropWidget will be highlighted as soon
  as a file being dragged enters the page. When
  <a href="classWt_1_1WFileDropWidget.html#a051b4928cb26446de1eb3617d0f8c954">global drop</a> is enabled, then a drop
  anywhere on the page will put the file in the WFileDropWidget.</dd>
  <dt>SqlConnection::executeSqlStateful()</dt>
  <dd><a href="classWt_1_1Dbo_1_1SqlConnection.html#a7ac824e554074898f10cf75b70a4a6b1">SqlConnection::executeSqlStateful()</a> allows to execute SQL that should be re-executed upon automatic reconnect. Automatic reconnect
  is currently supported for the <a href="classWt_1_1Dbo_1_1backend_1_1Postgres.html">Postgres</a>
  and <a href="classWt_1_1Dbo_1_1backend_1_1MySQL.html">MySQL</a> backends.</dd>
  <dt>WTableView: exposed touch events</dt>
  <dd>
    We made it possible to define custom behaviour upon touch events on WTableView, by
    adding the <a href="classWt_1_1WAbstractItemView.html#acd980e6a9eb110400f334e341f8386a4">touchStarted()</a>,
    <a href="classWt_1_1WAbstractItemView.html#aaf371c95c294c952be0eaac5b3f56af7">touchMoved()</a>, and
    <a href="classWt_1_1WAbstractItemView.html#a9f3bd68d6d5ca982b2a22bcd100ea271">touchEnded()</a> signals.
  </dd>
</dl>

<h2>Release 4.0.2 (November 24, 2017)</h2>
<p>This is a patch release that fixes a few problems with the build of Wt 4.0.1, and fixes a bug in Wt::Auth.</p>

<h2>Release 4.0.1 (November 21, 2017)</h2>
<p>This is a smaller release with mostly bugfixes, and some new features:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Added <a href="classWt_1_1WContainerWidget.html#acf75dda5024db05cf847c282f8a99117">WContainerWidget::addNew()</a> and similar methods</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Because writing code like this:</p>
    <div class="fragment">
      <div class="line">auto text = root()-&gt;addWidget(std::make_unique&lt;Wt::WText&gt;("Hello!"));</div>
    </div>
    <p>is a bit verbose, a shorthand was added that creates the widget and adds it to the container in one go:</p>
    <div class="fragment">
      <div class="line">auto text = root()-&gt;addNew&lt;Wt::WText&gt;("Hello!");</div>
    </div>
<p>
  <code>addNew</code> forwards its arguments to the constructor, just like <code>std::make_unique</code>.
  Along those lines, we added <a href="classWt_1_1WContainerWidget.html#a5a7e7b9fe21bdc38f7a270193ed83243">WContainerWidget::insertNew()</a> and <a href="classWt_1_1WTemplate.html#a240f910cd1e3d5b7876aa20f6b33767c">WTemplate::bindNew()</a>.
</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Added the <code>&lt;max-formdata-size&gt;</code> configuration option</dt>
  <dd>Previously, the maximum size of form data sent by Wt in a single POST request was capped to 5 MiB.
      In applications with a large amount of forms with a lot of data, that may not be enough,
      so <code>&lt;max-formdata-size&gt;</code> can be used to adjust this independently. Note that
      the maximum request size (and by consequence, the form data size) is still capped by
      <code>&lt;max-request-size&gt;</code>.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Release 4.0.0 (September 19, 2017)</h2>
<p>
  This release has all of the added features of Wt 3.3.8, but comes with many notable changes. In general,
  Wt 4 employs the more modern C++ style of C++11 and beyond. Support for compilers
  without sufficient C++11 support is dropped completely. Wt 4 aligns more with the
  <a href="https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md">C++ Core Guidelines</a>
  in a pragmatic way, while keeping the API familiar.
</p>
<h3>New features since Wt 3.3.8</h3>
<dl>
  <dt>Microsoft SQL Server backend for Wt::Dbo</dt>
  <dd>We've added Microsoft SQL Server support to Wt::Dbo, making it the sixth
      backend we support, alongside Sqlite, PostgreSQL, MySQL (and MariaDB),
      Firebird, and Oracle (not part of the open source Wt because of licensing).
      With this addition, Wt::Dbo now supports most commonly used relational database management systems.
      It's based on ODBC and works with Microsoft's ODBC Driver
      for SQL Server. With unixODBC, Linux and macOS are also supported.</dd>
  <dt>Added support for listening on multiple interfaces and ports to wthttp</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      With the multivalued <code>--http-listen</code> and <code>--https-listen</code> options,
      you can now listen on multiple interfaces and ports. For example, if you want to
      listen on port 8080 on all IPv4 and IPv6 interfaces, you can use:
    </p>
    <div class="fragment">
      <div class="line">--http-listen 0.0.0.0:8080 --https-listen [0::0]:8080</div>
    </div>
    <p>
      <code>--http-listen</code> and <code>--https-listen</code> obsolete the
      <code>--http-address</code>, <code>--http-port</code>, <code>--https-address</code>, and <code>--https-port</code>
      options.
    </p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<h3>Changes in Wt's memory model</h3>
<p>
Like before, the parent widget (e.g. a <a href="classWt_1_1WContainerWidget.html">WContainerWidget</a>) owns
its child widgets. This has not changed. Wt 4 makes ownership transfers more clear by using <code>std::unique_ptr</code>
There are no more owning raw pointers in Wt's public API.
</p>
<p>
By consequence of using <code>unique_ptr</code>, constructors no longer take a <code>parent</code> argument. For
convenience, <a href="classWt_1_1WContainerWidget.html#a3341360fc6cc1e86c1a42a3a54d9e0c7">addWidget()</a>
now returns a (non-owning) raw pointer. Instead of doing:
</p>
<div class="fragment">
  <div class="line"><span class="comment">// parent is a Wt::WContainerWidget*</span></div>
  <div class="line">Wt::WPushButton *button = new Wt::WPushButton("Click me", parent); <span class="comment">// Wt 3: parent owns the button</span></div>
</div>
<p>or:</p>
<div class="fragment">
  <div class="line">Wt::WPushButton *button = new Wt::WPushButton("Click me");</div>
  <div class="line">parent-&gt;addWidget(button); <span class="comment">// Wt 3: ownership is transferred to parent through addWidget</span></div>
</div>
<p>You can now do:</p>
<div class="fragment">
  <div class="line"><span class="comment">// Wt 4 (with C++14's std::make_unique)</span></div>
  <div class="line">Wt::WPushButton *button = parent-&gt;addWidget(std::make_unique&lt;Wt::WPushButton&gt;("Click me"));</div>
</div>
<p>
  <code>Wt::cpp14::make_unique</code> can be used instead of <code>std::make_unique</code> if C++14 support is unavailable.
</p>
<p>
Some classes were changed from the old single ownership
model to shared ownership through <code>std::shared_ptr</code>, like models (<a href="classWt_1_1WAbstractItemModel.html">WAbstractItemModel</a>, <a href="classWt_1_1Chart_1_1WAbstractChartModel.html">WAbstractChartModel</a>, and derivates) and <a href="classWt_1_1WValidator.html">validators</a>.
</p>
<p>
<a href="classWt_1_1Core_1_1observing__ptr.html">Wt::Core::observing_ptr</a> was introduced. This pointer will
be notified when the object it points to is deleted. <code>observing_ptr</code>s are intended to be used within the
scope of a <a href="classWt_1_1WApplication.html">WApplication</a> and are not thread safe. Every
<a href="classWt_1_1WObject.html">WObject</a> (and by consequence, every <a href="classWt_1_1WWidget.html">widget</a>)
is an <a href="classWt_1_1Core_1_1observing_ptr.html">observable</a>, so its lifetime can be observed with
an <code>observing_ptr</code>. Their use is entirely optional, but they may be useful when the lifetime of an
object is not always clear.
</p>
<h3>Header files now end in .h</h3>
Wt 3 used extensionless headers. This confuses many editors and IDEs.
For Wt 4, the <code>.h</code> extension was added, and using the old style headers is deprecated. You can use the
Python script <a href="https://github.com/emweb/wt/blob/wt4/migrate/wt4_add_h_to_includes.py">migrate/wt4_add_h_to_includes.py</a> to help update your Wt includes.
<h3>Enums replaced by enum classes</h3>
Many enums were replaced with enum classes, and many have been moved from class scope to namespace scope, e.g.:
<div class="fragment">
  <div class="line">enum SelectionMode {</div>
  <div class="line">&nbsp;&nbsp;NoSelection = 0,</div>
  <div class="line">&nbsp;&nbsp;SingleSelection = 1,</div>
  <div class="line">&nbsp;&nbsp;ExtendedSelection = 3</div>
  <div class="line">};</div>
</div>
became:
<div class="fragment">
  <div class="line">enum class SelectionMode {</div>
  <div class="line">&nbsp;&nbsp;None = 0,</div>
  <div class="line">&nbsp;&nbsp;Single = 1,</div>
  <div class="line">&nbsp;&nbsp;Extended = 3</div>
  <div class="line">};</div>
</div>
Some enums were preserved in places were the added verbosity
was undesirable, like the <a href="group__dbo.html#ga1d0ec6819b1bf5b7a88ad030b91ca564">Wt::Dbo::RelationType</a> enum.
<h3>Replacements for Boost</h3>
    Many features of Boost that Wt relied on were made obsolete by C++11. Many other Boost features have been replaced
    with C++11-based alternatives.

    <dl>
      <dt>Choice between Boost.Asio and standalone Asio</dt>
      <dd>
        The CMake option <code>WT_ASIO_IMPLEMENTATION</code> allows to choose between <code>boost</code> and <code>standalone</code>
	Asio.</dd>
      <dt>Removal of Boost usage in Wt headers</dt>
      <dd>
        If standalone Asio is used, the installed headers of Wt no longer include any Boost headers.
	The Windows builds of Wt 4 will from now on no longer include Boost,
	including only the standalone Asio headers instead. This just about halves the size of the installer.
	If you want to use Boost, you'll have to provide your own. You can find prebuilt Boost binaries for Windows
	<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost-binaries/">here</a>.
      </dd>
      <dt>Boost.Date_Time was replaced with Howard Hinnant's <code>std::chrono</code>-based date implementation</dt>
      <dd>
      The author of the <code>std::chrono</code> standard has created a
      <a href="https://github.com/HowardHinnant/date">library for dates and time zones</a>.
	This library is proposed for inclusion into the C++ standard in the future. For now, Wt includes
	this date and time zone library (at this moment, this is version 2.2). This is used for all time-related
	classes, like <a href="classWt_1_1WDate.html">WDate</a>,
	<a href="classWt_1_1WTime.html">WTime</a>, <a href="classWt_1_1WDateTime.html">WDateTime</a>,
	and <a href="classWt_1_1WLocalDateTime.html">WLocalDateTime</a>.
      </dd>
      <dt>
        Boost.Any replaced by <code>Wt::cpp17::any</code>
      </dt>
      <dd>
        <a href="classWt_1_1WStandardItemModel.html">WStandardItemModel</a> relied heavily on
	<code>boost::any</code>. This was replaced with <code>Wt::cpp17::any</code>. You can choose the
	implementation of <code>any</code> to use with the CMake option <code>WT_CPP17_ANY_IMPLEMENTATION</code>.
	Valid options are:
	<ul>
	  <li><a href="https://github.com/thelink2012/any">thelink2012</a>: this is the default implementation, included in Wt</li>
	  <li><code>experimental</code> for <code>std::experimental::any</code></li>
	  <li><code>std</code> for C++17's <code>std::any</code></li>
	</ul>
      </dd>
      <dt>Boost.Signals2 replaced with own implementation</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          Wt did not use many of the features of Boost.Signals2. Since C++11, many more efficient alternatives
	  have been created. Wt 4's implementation, based on
	  <a href="https://testbit.eu/cpp11-signal-system-performance/">this blog post</a>, offers better performance
	  and more understandable stack traces. It's now no longer necessary to
	  use <code>std::bind</code> with lambda functions, e.g.:
        </p>
	<div class="fragment"><div class="line">button-&gt;clicked().connect(std::bind([]{ std::cout &lt;&lt; "Clicked!" &lt;&lt; std::endl; })); <span class="comment">// Wt 3</span></div></div>
        <p>
	  can be changed to:
        </p>
	<div class="fragment"><div class="line">button-&gt;clicked().connect([]{ std::cout &lt;&lt; "Clicked!" &lt;&lt; std::endl; }); <span class="comment">// Wt 4</span></div></div>
	<p>
	  Boost.Signals2, together with <code>boost::bind</code>, allowed you to automatically disconnect slots
	  when one of their bound arguments was deleted, if the argument was a derived class of
	  <code>boost::signals2::trackable</code>. In Wt 4, this is no longer the case. Instead, you
	  can provide a target <a class="classWt_1_1WObject.html">WObject</a> as the first argument to
	  the connect function, and Wt will disconnect the slot when the target <code>WObject</code> is deleted.
	</p>
	<p>
	  <code>WApplication::bind</code> has been removed, and instead
	  <a href="classWt_1_1Core_1_1observable.html#a8ef9ce1dc22e3bae13e198b27e6b64cc">observable::bindSafe</a>
	  was introduced. <code>bindSafe</code> will guard the <code>observable</code>, returning a function
	  object that doesn't do anything if the <code>observable</code> has been deleted.
	</p>
      </dd>
      <dt>Other Boost libraries obsoleted by C++11</dt>
      <dd>Boost.Thread, Boost.Regex and Boost.Random were mostly replaced by their STL counterparts. Only
          Boost.Thread is used internally in Wt 4 because Wt uses some mutex functionality that's not part of
          C++11.</dd>
    </dl>
  <h3>Other changes:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
	<a href="classWt_1_1ItemDataRole.html">ItemDataRole</a> is now a class instead of an enum.
      </li>
      <li>
	Wt 4 assumes that <code>std::string</code> is UTF-8 encoded by default, so
	<a href="classWt_1_1WString.html#a64d17e31e557208ab8d8ea765c1e52b8">WString(std::string)</a>
	will assume that the argument is UTF-8 encoded. Overloads for new C++11 string types
	(<code>std::u16string</code>, <code>std::u32string</code>) have been added.
      </li>
      <li>
	Intervals and other durations previously indicated by <code>int</code>s have been replaced by
	<code>std::chrono::duration</code>s, e.g. in
	<a href="classWt_1_1WIOService.html#a5e445e207ee36f75cea4ba7ae321d7dc">WIOService::schedule()</a> or
	<a href="classWt_1_1Http_1_1Client.html#a84856aabdef30b9e91bb3c4d30b9ecd1">Wt::Http::Client::setTimeout()</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
	<a href="classWt_1_1WBoxLayout.html">WBoxLayout</a> is now implemented with flexbox instead of JavaScript
	by default. Wt will fallback to the old JavaScript implementation when functionality unavailable in
	the flexbox implementation is used, use
	<a href="classWt_1_1WLayout.html#a9cd0547c710e357e4c688ccfdb790d8f">WBoxLayout::setPreferredImplementation</a>
	to set a preferred implementation.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="classWt_1_1WObject.html#a64ce31cadb378c4eba81224f43bf493d">setObjectName()</a> no longer affects the <code>id</code> of a widget. Instead, it is
        placed into an extra attribute called <code>data-object-name</code>. <code>selenium/wtLocators.js</code>
        has been updated to reflect this change.
      </li>
    </ul>
  <h3>Removal of deprecated functionality</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
	Everything that was marked as deprecated in Wt 3.3.7 has been removed,
	including <code>Wt::Ext</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
	<code>WScrollArea</code> was removed, use CSS or
	<a href="classWt_1_1WContainerWidget.html#af3d9510f569deed060689aa509ecc831">WContainerWidget::setOverflow()</a> instead.
      </li>
    </ul>

<h2>Release 3.3.8 (August 16, 2017)</h2>
<p>
  This release consists of bug fixes and some new features:
</p>
<dl>
  <dt>
    OpenID Connect support
  </dt>
  <dd>
    As we've previously announced
    <a href="https://www.webtoolkit.eu/wt/blog/2017/06/20/announcing_openid_connect_support_in_wt">on our blog</a>,
    Wt now supports OpenID Connect. All you need to do to use any OpenID Connect based service is
    configure a <a href="classWt_1_1Auth_1_1OidcService.html">Wt::Auth::OidcService</a>. You can also make your
    own OpenID Connect identity provider. Check out the accompanying
    <a href="https://github.com/emweb/wt/tree/master/examples/feature/oidc">OpenID Connect feature example</a>.
  </dd>
  <dt>
    On Windows: font support based on DirectWrite
  </dt>
  <dd>
  <p>Wt 3.3.7 already introduced the Direct2D backend for <a href="classWt_1_1WRasterImage.html">WRasterImage</a>.
    Wt 3.3.8 further expands
    on this by adding DirectWrite-based font support. This means that Wt 3.3.8 will be able to
    select the appropriate fonts for every glyph, without requiring Pango. Pango was always
    difficult to distribute on Windows, so we never included Pango in the binary distribution, relying on
    very basic font support instead, replacing unknown characters by question marks. Now, you
    can expect much better Unicode support with DirectWrite on Windows.</p>
    <p>This means that the binary release of Wt on Windows is now built with Direct2D and DirectWrite.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    Wt::Dbo: added <a href="structWt_1_1Dbo_1_1sql__value__traits.html">sql_value_traits</a> for
    <a href="classWt_1_1Json_1_1Object.html">Wt::Json::Object</a> and
    <a href="classWt_1_1Json_1_1Array.html">Wt::Json::Array</a>.
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Quite often, the need arises to store some unindexed data with arbitrary structure in a database.
       A common solution is to store JSON as a string. To facilitate this, we've included implementations
       of <a href="structWt_1_1Dbo_1_1sql_value_traits.html">sql_value_traits</a> for
       <a href="classWt_1_1Json_1_1Object.html">Wt::Json::Object</a> and
       <a href="classWt_1_1Json_1_1Array.html">Wt::Json::Array</a> in
       <code>Wt/Dbo/WtSqlTraits</code>. This allows you to store <code>Wt::Json</code> Objects and Arrays
       just like you any other field.</p>
    <p>Additionally, we've made the <code>Wt::Json</code> API a bit more friendly, by adding support
    for initializer lists (when using C++11), and implicit constructors for
    <a href="classWt_1_1Json_1_1Value.html">Wt::Json::Value</a>
    from 
    <a href="classWt_1_1Json_1_1Object.html">Wt::Json::Object</a> and
    <a href="classWt_1_1Json_1_1Array.html">Wt::Json::Array</a>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    Added <code>&lt;allowed-origins&gt;</code> configuration option for CORS
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Wt used to allow almost any origin, to allow Wt applications to be embedded in any page using
    WidgetSet mode. Although Wt encodes session IDs in URLs rather than cookies by default, this
    could still pose a security risk in some cases. In Wt 3.3.8, CORS support has been updated:
    Wt now only allows cross-origin resource sharing for WidgetSet entry points, and trusts no
    origin by default. You can specify the allowed origins using the <code>&lt;allowed-origins&gt;</code>
    tag in the configuration file. Using <code>&lt;allowed-origins&gt;*&lt;/allowed-origins&gt;</code>
    restores the old behaviour.
  </dd>
  <dt>
    Other small improvements:
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li>Any <code>boost::asio::io_service</code> can now be used with <a href="classWt_1_1Http_1_1Client.html">Wt::Http::Client</a>,
	  instead of just <a href="classWt_1_1WIOService.html">Wt::WIOService</a>.</li>
      <li>Added support for <code>PATCH</code> requests in <a href="classWt_1_1WResource.html">WResource</a> and
	<a href="classWt_1_1Http_1_1Client.html">Wt::Http::Client</a>,
	next to <code>GET</code>, <code>POST</code>, <code>PUT</code>, and <code>DELETE</code>.
      <li>wthttp connector: added support for forward secrecy with the <code>--ssl-prefer-server-ciphers</code> option.</li>
      <li>Added the <code>num-session-threads</code> configuration parameter, to set the amount of threads per session when
	  using dedicated process mode. By default, the main process and the session threads use the same amount of threads.</li>
      <li>The <a href="https://github.com/emweb/wt/tree/master/examples/te-benchmark">te-benchmark</a>
	  example was added, implementing the TechEmpower framework benchmarks.
          This example also demonstrates how Wt can be used to write RESTful services. Improved, less verbose, support for
          RESTful services is planned in a future release.</li>
      <li>Added <a href="classWt_1_1Dbo_1_1FixedSqlConnectionPool.html#a955e2ce03d8d45e8738f6ff718614601">Wt::Dbo::FixedSqlConnectionPool::setTimeout()</a>, to set a timeout for obtaining a connection.</li>
      <li>Added <a href="classWt_1_1Dbo_1_1backend_1_1Postgres.html#acb13461474cc43bc9e8a51b844a051f3">Wt::Dbo::backend::Postgres::setTimeout()</a>, to set a timeout for queries.</li>
      <li>Added libunwind support for printing stacktraces. Enable this with the <code>ENABLE_UNWIND</code> CMake option.</li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
</dl>

<h2>Release 3.3.7 (March 31, 2017)</h2>
<p>
  This release fixes many bugs, but also introduces some new features:
</p>
<dl>
  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1WFileDropWidget.html">WFileDropWidget</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    The WFileDropWidget is a new widget that allows you to upload a file or multiple files by dragging them onto an area.
  </dd>
  <dt>
    Scroll visibility
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Some applications require you to know whether a widget is currently visible within the viewport, or whether it is
    scrolled out of view, e.g. to load more content as you scroll down the page. You can now enable scroll visibility
    detection with
    <a href="classWt_1_1WWidget.html#a5d403e0390841df77a23445b28044d5d">WWidget::setScrollVisibilityEnabled(bool)</a>,
    and react to changes in visibility with
    <a href="classWt_1_1WWidget.html#aa5ce605dd465e06f3e3c2dbce2a4098e">WWidget::scrollVisibilityChanged()</a>.
    A new scrollvisibility feature example has been added to demonstrate this infinite scrolling application.
  </dd>
  <dt>
    Touch events
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Although Wt already supported touch interactions in the charting library, touch events were previously
    not exposed by Wt. Now,
    we've added <a href="classWt_1_1WTouchEvent.html">WTouchEvent</a>, and the touchStarted, touchEnded, and touchMoved
    events have been added to
    <a href="classWt_1_1WInteractWidget.html">WInteractWidget</a>.
    Also, <a href="classWt_1_1WInteractWidget.html#a556c14d02388720b1d95b2149be2e867">draggable widgets</a> can now also
    be dragged after a long press, and you can select a range using a double touch in
    <a href="classWt_1_1WTableView.html">WTableView</a> and <a href="classWt_1_1WTreeView.html">WTreeView</a>.
  </dd>
  <dt>
    Combined session tracking mode
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      The default session tracking method for Wt is URL rewriting, using JavaScript to hide the session id from
      the address bar. Alternatively, cookies can be used with the Auto option, falling back to URL rewriting when
      cookies are not available. However, the cookie-based method did not allow for multiple sessions within the
      same browser.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to make the URL rewriting method with requirement 6.5.10 of the PCI Data Security Standard, while not
      sacrificing the ability to have multiple sessions, a new Combined session tracking strategy has been added.
      Wt already makes it difficult to steal a session when the session id is discovered, but resources are not as
      protected. The Combined session tracking strategy uses URL rewriting in combination with a cookie that is shared
      between sessions as an extra measure against session hijacking. This is the most secure strategy, but it will
      deny access if cookie support is not available.
    </p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    Wraparound for <a href="classWt_1_1WSpinBox.html">WSpinBox</a> and <a href="classWt_1_1WTimeEdit.html">WTimeEdit</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    WSpinBox will now wrap around from its maximum to its minimum if you <a href="classWt_1_1WSpinBox.html#a08413e777fefab00e36dc8d6c492bda5">enable wraparound</a>. WTimeEdit will take advantage of this feature by default.
  </dd>
  <dt>
    On Windows: Direct2D implementation of WRasterImage
  </dt>
  <dd>
    We've added another implementation for WRasterImage on Windows: Direct2D. When building Wt, this
    implementation will be enabled by default. This allows to remove the dependency on GraphicsMagick or
    Skia on Windows, simplifying the build process.
  </dd>
  <dt>
    Some minor extra features:
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li>
	It's now possible to retrieve a vector of all request headers with <a href="classWt_1_1Http_1_1Request.html#a0afe45bf93bb77270a85c75ca67cd521">Wt::Http::Request::headers()</a> in <a href="classWt_1_1WResource.html#a3a740f8cc29e2e6e4e58defc9c88b8b6">handleRequest</a> when implementing a WResource. It is still recommended, and more efficient, to use <a href="classWt_1_1Http_1_1Request.html#ade2596aa6802a63e21460094ea30a4d9">headerValue</a>, but retrieving a vector of all headers could be useful for debugging purposes.
      </li>
      <li>
	In an effort to reduce the amount of JavaScript generated by the charting API, the
	<a href="classWt_1_1WPainter.html#abccad19493d7461ca08c9e50ad7326f1">WPainter::drawStencilAlongPath()</a>
	method was added to WPainter.
      </li>

<h2>Release 3.3.6 (July 13, 2016)</h2>
<p>
 This release has a focus on bug fixes and some new features:
</p>
<dl>
  <dt>
    Support for WebSocket compression in wthttp
  </dt>
  <dd>
    WebSocket traffic is now compressed, if possible.
  </dd>
  <dt>
    Time entry improvements
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <a href="classWt_1_1WTimeEdit.html">WTimeEdit</a> now supports AM/PM in its format,
    <a href="classWt_1_1WTimeValidator.html">WTimeValidator</a> now allows to select a minimum
    and maximum time and supports multiple formats,
    <a href="classWt_1_1WTimePicker.html">WTimePicker</a> can now work up to
    millisecond precision, and is now rendered with spinboxes.
  </dd>
  <dt>
    Skia version updated
  </dt>
  <dd>
    The Skia backend for <a href="classWt_1_1WRasterImage.html">WRasterImage</a> is now compatible with more recent versions of Skia. If you need
    to support an older version of Skia, use <code>-DWT_SKIA_OLD=ON</code>. The Skia version of the Windows builds
    has been updated from 394c7bb to 834d9e1.
  </dd>
  <dt>
    Wt::Dbo
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li>
      It's now possible to mark foreign keys as literal with a &ldquo;&gt;&rdquo; prefix, so Wt::Dbo can better map to
      an existing schema. Note that for consistency, this also means that the schema generated for ManyToMany relationships
      has been changed to include the id column names if a joinId has been specified. If you specify a joinId for ManyToMany
      relationships, you'll have to change it to include a &ldquo;&gt;&rdquo; before it in order to keep the same database schema.
      </li>
      <li>
	The <code>size</code> argument of <a href="group__dbo.html#gac089020eff000d9e2c4ef72cf715bd21">belongsTo()</a> has been
	removed, since it served no actual purpose.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    Scroll position
  </dt>
  <dd>
    It's now possible to retrieve the scroll position of a
    <a href="classWt_1_1WContainerWidget.html">WContainerWidget</a>
    with
    <a href="classWt_1_1WContainerWidget.html#a0a7ce553b2b5107412a3bed8700355cb">scrollTop()</a>
    and
    <a href="classWt_1_1WContainerWidget.html#a9a60d382fcd1490081087ce4f3649864">scrollLeft()</a>.
  </dd>
  <dt>
    Invalidation of stateless slots

    <a href="classWt_1_1WObject.html#a6dde4ce1e833a9966709daf3c0dedc9f">WObject::isNotStateless()</a>
    has been added, so functions called from functions that are marked as stateless can unmark
    it as stateless, reverting to plain server-side dynamic UI updates.
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1Auth_1_1Dbo_1_1UserDatabase.html">Auth::Dbo::UserDatabase</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    The <a href="classWt_1_1Auth_1_1Dbo_1_1UserDatabase.html">Dbo UserDatabase</a> implementation now
    compares e-mail addresses case insensitively. The <a href="classWt_1_1Auth_1_1AuthService.html">AuthService</a>
    can be passed in the constructor, so the <a href="classWt_1_1Auth_1_1Dbo_1_1UserDatabase.html">UserDatabase</a>
    knows whether the IdentityPolicy is EmailAddressIdentity.
  </dd>
  <dt>
    Charting library
  </dt>
  <dd>
    There have been many bug fixes and improvements to the charting library and the interactive features
    introduced in Wt 3.3.5:
    <ul>
      <li>Series <a href="classWt_1_1Chart_1_1WCartesianChart.html#ad05997dbc2d59862e38272985abda9a9">can be selected</a>
      on a <a href="classWt_1_1Chart_1_1WCartesianChart.html">WCartesianChart</a>.

	  have been deprecated in favor of the easier to use
	  <a href="classWt_1_1Chart_1_1WAxis.html#a0be187399e7cb4877f2c5e3837eba6ea">WAxis::setZoomRange()</a>.
	  You can listen to changes in zoom range with the
	  <a href="classWt_1_1Chart_1_1WAxis.html#a7e432917f0f23f18db3a043397a81904">WAxis::zoomRangeChanged()</a> signal.</li>
       <li>Series set as hidden will still be shown on a <a href="classWt_1_1Chart_1_1WAxisSliderWidget.html">WAxisSliderWidget</a>.
	   The typical application for this is to show a coarse model on the slider widget, and a more detailed one on the chart.</li>
      <li>
	  In order to provide better performance for charts containing a lot of data, the charting library has been
	  overhauled to use <a href="classWt_1_1Chart_1_1WAbstractChartModel.html">WAbstractChartModel</a>s,
	  instead of <a href="classWt_1_1WAbstractItemModel.html">WAbstractItemModel</a>s, avoiding the use of
	  boost::any. The <a href="classWt_1_1Chart_1_1WStandardChartProxyModel.html">WStandardChartProxyModel</a>
	  wraps a <a href="classWt_1_1WAbstractItemModel.html">WAbstractItemModel</a> so that those can still be used with charts.
	  Note that this changes the return type of the
	  <a href="classWt_1_1Chart_1_1WAbstractChart.html#a477522bb1720fb20006c81be455b3366">WAbstractChart::model()</a> method.
      </li>
      <li>A chart's axes can now be <a href="classWt_1_1Chart_1_1WAxis.html#a2bb7c8ec67ed2ff0b57953ea40cd87ef">inverted</a>.
      <li>Stacked series: negative values are now stacked separately from positive values.</li>
      <li><a href="classWt_1_1Chart_1_1CurveLabel.html">Curve labels</a> can now be drawn on charts, so that curves,
          or certain points on curves, can be labeled.</li>

	  has been modified with an argument
          <a href="structWt_1_1Chart_1_1AxisConfig.html">AxisConfig</a>, so that different axis ticks can be drawn depending
	  on the side that the axis is dawn on, or the zoom level it is drawn at. This is a breaking change if you override getLabelTicks.
	  <a href="classWt_1_1Chart_1_1WAxis.html#a71928aabf753854274d753e266aabfc2">WAxis::setLabelTransform()</a>
	  as a simpler method to change the tick
	  labels depending on the side the axis is drawn on.</li>
      <li><a href="classWt_1_1Chart_1_1WDataSeries.html">WDataSeries</a> is no longer a simple value class. The interface of
          <a href="classWt_1_1Chart_1_1WCartesianChart.html">WCartesianChart</a> has been modified to reflect that: the old
	  interface that copies WDataSeries over has been deprecated in favor of an interface that takes pointers to
	  <a href="classWt_1_1Chart_1_1WDataSeries.html">WDataSeries</a>.</li>
      <li>It's now possible to <a href="classWt_1_1Chart_1_1WDataSeries.html#ae668a1a90ccf668e426fc2d9e370bf2c">specify a different model</a>
      for each <a href="classWt_1_1Chart_1_1WDataSeries.html">WDataSeries</a>.</li>

<h2>Release 3.3.5 (Dec 31, 2015)</h2>
<p>
 This release has a focus on bug fixes but also one or two new features:
</p>

<dl>
  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1Chart_1_1WCartesianChart.html">Chart::WCartesianChart</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
	WCartesianChart has several new features that allow interaction with the
	chart without server roundtrips. These features include zoom, pan,
	crosshair and follow curve functionality.

	This is only available if the chart is drawn
	on an HTML canvas. This is the default rendering method on modern browsers.
	
	When enabled, the crosshair will follow mouse movement,
	and show in the top right corner the coordinate
	(according to X axis and the first Y axis)  corresponding to this position.
  </dd>
  <dt>
  <a href="classWt_1_1Chart_1_1WAxisSliderWidget.html">Chart::WAxisSliderWidget</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
	WAxisSliderWidget lets you easily focus on a particular range by selecting an XAxis. It will create a sliding widget where you can change the size of the focused region by dragging the blue handles, and change the position by dragging the selected area. When using touch, the size of this area can also be changed using a pinch movement.
  </dd>
  <dt>
  <a href="classWt_1_1WPainter.html">WPainter</a>, <a href="classWt_1_1WJavaScriptHandle.html">WJavascriptHandle</a>, <a href="classWt_1_1WCanvasPaintDevice.html">WCanvasPaintDevice</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
  The above functionality was implemented by making client-side interaction possible for a scene rendered
  on WCanvasPaintDevice. For this purpose, for several primitives used to draw on a canvas, we provide
  a JavaScript handle and complementary API to manipulate these objects in JavaScript code. In this way you
  can keep the bulk of the painting code in C++, and allow manipulation from within JavaScript.
  Such JavaScript handlers have been made available for <a href="classWt_1_1WTransform.html">WTransform</a>, <a href="classWt_1_1WPen.html">WPen</a>, <a href="classWt_1_1WBrush.html">WBrush</a>, <a href="classWt_1_1WPointF.html">WPointF</a>, <a href="classWt_1_1WRectF.html">WRectF</a> and <a href="classWt_1_1WPainterPath.html">WPainterPath</a>.
  </dd>

  <dt> <a href="classWt_1_1WAnchor.html">WAnchor</a> target (such as this window, or new window) moved to <a href="classWt_1_1WLink.html#afda591cd277562d5c8ea723733290790">WLink</a></dt>
  <dd>As WLink is used in several places (including for example inside item data models), the target can now be specified in more places in the same consistent way. However, since until now a WAnchor was the owner of the TargetType, this may break existing code which calls WAnchor::setTarget() before WAnchor::setLink(), as the latter overrides the target.
  </dd>

  <dt>A new <a href="namespaceWt.html#a6c93a6e97016801a310275457e43f333">TargetDownload</a> target was added for links.</dt>
  <dd>Until now it was recommended to use TargetNewWindow as otherwise this would interfere with the rendering of the current page (since browsers are unaware of the content-type and content-disposition of the target link until after it unloaded the current page. The new TargetDownload option is implemented using the new HTML5 download attribute or, if not supported, by targeting a hidden iFrame contained in the page.
  </dd>

  <dt>The included SQLite version was updated</dt>
  <dd>
  The SQLite version bundled with Wt::Dbo has been updated to version 3.8.10.1. The changelog can be found <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/news.html">here</a>
  </dd>

  <dt>Support for seconds editing in <a href="classWt_1_1WTimePicker.html#a4d19d3ad8bdf0a9a3e35d84f3d298994">WTimePicker</a></dt>
  <dd>WTimePicker was missing the seconds, we've also added the setSecondStep() method.
  </dd>

  <dt><a href="classWt_1_1WCheckBox.html#a2d741874682e9a683d40527b03615d32">WCheckBox::setPartialStateSelectable()</a></dt>
  <dd>Before it was only possible to set the partial state of the WCheckbox when creating the Widget.
  We've added a method WCheckBox::setPartialStateSelectable(bool) which will allow the user to select indeterminate state. This is false by default;
  </dd>

  <dt>New client side connection monitor</dt>
  <dd>The <a href="classWt_1_1WApplication.html#ab6ae1117e316f1a7b31449aaeb83c9cf">WApplication::setConnectionMonitor()</a> method will let the user register a Javascript object that will be notified on connection changes (connection, disconnection, websockets enabled/disabled..)
  The monitor will trigger the onChange method of the provided Javascript object</dd>

  <dt>Support for custom HTML tags for a widgets</dt>
  <dd>We've added <a href="classWt_1_1WWebWidget.html#adf6034e0e715138cae479eae6e324ce6">WWebWidget::setHtmlTagName()</a> that will change the current html tag instead of using the one chosen by Wt by default. This allows the user to create widgets that are not provided by Wt, such as for example semantic tags.
  </dd>

  <dt>Wt::Dbo: allow to forward declare related classes</dt>
  <dd>It is now possible to forward declare all classes that are being referenced in a <a href="group__dbo.html#gaa3de862f9544c4d30b8cbcac4b50feba">belongsTo()</a>, <a href="group__dbo.html#ga00a060d5f4764f673948989f21837548">hasOne()</a> or <a href="group__dbo.html#ga570b71f937c991b000b9db01b327a363">hasMany()</a> relation, helping to reduce the compile time pain of Wt::Dbo.</dd>

<h2>Release 3.3.4 (Mar 25, 2015)</h2>

<p>
 This release has a focus on bug fixes but also one or two new features,
 of which the following are the most notable:
</p>

<dl>
  <dt>
    Support for dedicated session processes with wthttp connector.
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Until now, only the FastCGI connector allowed the use of dedicated
    processes for individual sessions, by spawning a new process for
    each new session. This functionality has also been added to the
    wthttp connector. In this implementation, the manager process will
    act as a reverse proxy to the dedicated session processes.

    This has as major benefit that there is no longer a choice between
    dedicated session processes on the one hand (supported by FastCGI)
    and support for WebSockets on the other hand (supported by the
    built-in httpd). In fact, there remains little reason to prefer
    FastCGI over the built-in httpd: in those situations where you
    want a proper http server as a front-end, you can still use
    HAproxy or NGINX (or Apache, if you must) as a reverse proxy to
    wthttp.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1WIdentityProxyModel.html">WIdentityProxyModel</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    This new proxy model simply forwards the structure of the source
    model, without any transformation, and can be used for
    implementing proxy models that reimplement data(), but retain all
    other characteristics of the source model.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1Chart_1_1WAbstractChart.html#ac895fb1d1437f51629b49246eda66e3d">Chart::WAbstractChart::setAutoLayoutEnabled()</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Until now, you were responsible for configuring the padding around
    the chart area to accommodate for axis labels, titles, and
    legend. While this is still the default behaviour, we added an
    option to let the chart derive the required padding (using
    approximate font-metrics available server-side).
  </dd>


  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1Chart_1_1WCartesianChart.html#a1c97590b1bd4ee9324822967d6e72333">Chart::WCartesianChart::setAxis()</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Whereas previously a chart axis was a "value class", it is now a
    proper polymorphic class, and you can provide your own
    implementation. In this way you can customize things like for
    example label strings.
  </dd>  

  <dt>
    Several new features in the 3D charts library.
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="classWt_1_1Chart_1_1WAbstractDataSeries3D.html#a0ac582c98fe58f36e0d60f11b5627656">

<h2>Release 3.3.3 (May 27, 2014)</h2>

<p>
 This release has a focus on bug fixes but also one or two new features:
</p>

<dl>
  <dt>
    Improved Meta header support.
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Because WApplication meta header API was restricted to only work
    in certain circumstances, we have now added the ability to define
    meta headers (with the option to apply them to specific user agents)
    also in the configuration file.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1WWidget.html#ab4086c221a56e81dd067be47303b5862">WWidget::setDeferredToolTip()</a>
    </dt>
  <dd>
    This function is an alternative to setToolTip(), useful when a
    tooltip text is not trivial to fetch or create. Using this
    function, the tool tip (HTML) text can now be loaded on-demand
    instead of needing to be preset on (each) widget. This also works
    for tooltips set from a WAbstractItemModel using the
    new <a href="group__modelview.html#ga1d77c4de293aebfacbdde124de06b8b0">ItemHasDeferredTooltip</a>
    item flag.
  </dd>

    </dt>
  <dd>
    Support for input masks was added, which guides the user to enter
    data in the correct format.
  </dd>
</dl>

<hr>

<h2>Release 3.3.2 (March 12, 2014)</h2>

<p>
 This release has a focus on bug fixes and a few larger new developments.
</p>

<h3>A) New classes:</h3>

<dl>
  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1Chart_1_1WCartesian3DChart.html">3D Charts
    (Chart::WCartesian3DChart, ...)</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    A 3D charting library was added, based on
    <a href="classWt_1_1WGLWidget.html">WGLWidget</a>, and integrated
    with the existing 2D charting framework.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1Dbo_1_1JsonSerializer.html">Dbo::JsonSerializer</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    This is a utility which serializes Dbo objects (including
    relations) to JSon, leveraging the same persist() function used
    for serialization to the database.
  </dd>

</dl>

<h3>B) Main improvements:</h3>

<dl>
  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1WBootstrapTheme.html">WBootstrapTheme</a>
    </dt>
  <dd>
    Support for bootstrap version 3 was added, so now you have the
    choice between bootstrap version 2 or 3. Needless to say, you
    should probably target version 3 for new development work if you
    can live with its restricted browser support.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1WGLWidget.html">WGLWidget</a>
    </dt>
  <dd>
    Next to the existing client-side WebGL-based implementation, a
    server-side OpenGL-based implementation was added for fallback
    scenarios where WebGL is not available, or when scene complexity
    is so big that a server-side solution is simply better performing
    because of lower bandwidth needed.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1WRasterImage.html">WRasterImage</a>
    </dt>
  <dd>
    Next to the GraphicsMagick-based implementation, a skia-based
    implementation has been added (which provides much higher
    performance most notably on Windows platforms).
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1WString.html">WString</a>
    </dt>
  <dd>
    Until now, Wt defaults to the C++ global locale for conversion
    between a string literal (std::string, const char *) and
    WString. In practice, UTF-8 is an (increasingly) better choice
    since UTF-8 is a pragmatic encoding covering the entire Unicode
    range, and the encoding used by the library throughout. We've now
    added a setDefaultEncoding() function which can be used to
    configure the default encoding as UTF-8.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    wthttp HTTP/WebSockets front-end server
  </dt>
  <dd>
    We've given the http front-end a much needed overhaul, making it
    deal better with long-lived connections typical for WebSockets
    applications, and fix some nasty issues at the same time.
    We also took the opportunity to optimize its performance by
    reducing the number of system calls for writing request
    responses, and by avoiding memory allocations during request parsing.
  </dd>
</dl>

<h3>C) Non-backwards compatible changes</h3>

<dl>
  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1WDatePicker.html">WDatePicker</a>,
    <a href="classWt_1_1WDateEdit.html">WDateEdit</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    The date pickers will now default to interpreting a single click
    as a date selection and also closing the calendar.
  </dd>
</dl>
<hr>

<h2>Release 3.3.1 (October, 16 2013)</h2>

<p>
 This release has a focus on bug fixes and other cleanups after the big
 changes that went into 3.3.0.
</p>

<h3>A) New classes:</h3>

<dl>
  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1WLocalDateTime.html">WLocalDateTime</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    So far, the library only provided date/time classes that dealt with
    UTC time (or that at least is the intended use). In this release
    we have added functionality to also deal with date's in a specific
    time zone, which includes this new type as well as improvements in
    WDateTime to convert to local date time, and time zone information
    in WEnvironment and WLocale.

<h3>B) Main improvements:</h3>

<dl>
  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1WComboBox.html">WComboBox</a>
    </dt>
  <dd>
    The combo box now interprets LevelRole data to display headers
    (using HTML &lt;optgroup&lt; elements). Another improvement is
    that now the combobox saves its single selection while the model
    is updated.
  </dd>

    <a href="classWt_1_1WDialog.html">WDialog</a>
    </dt>
  <dd>
    Modal dialogs can now be created and destroyed in any order
    without confusing the 'silk screen'. We now also consistently
    interpret an enter press in the dialog to invoke the default
    button added to the dialog footer (if there is one).
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1WMessageBox.html">WMessageBox</a>
    </dt>
  <dd>
    Several improvements include the ability to indicate what buttons
    are the default and escape buttons with setDefaultButton() or
    button->setDefault() and setEscapeButton(), and the (long overdue)
    implementation of icons!
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1WTextEdit.html">WTextEdit</a>

  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="namespaceWt_1_1Render.html">Render library</a>
    </dt>
  <dd>
    We've added a CSS style sheet parser which will parse and apply
    style rules in &lt;style&gt; blocks (or loaded through the API),
    and expanded CSS support to improve table rendering
    (including border-collapse border model and repeated table
    headers), relative/absolute positioning, and page-break-before/after
    support.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1Auth_1_1AbstractUserDatabase.html">Auth::AbstractUserDatabase</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    A setIdentity() method was added to modify an existing identity
    (e.g. username) and updateAuthToken() was added to update an
    existing token (e.g. keeping the expiration time but changing the
    hash).
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1Dbo_1_1Query.html">Dbo::Query</a>

  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1Dbo_1_1QueryModel.html">Dbo::QueryModel</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    The model now implements toRawIndex() and fromRawIndex() methods to

  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="group__json.html">Wt::Json (JSON library)</a>

    We've deprecated the exceptions (Invalid[Date][Time]Exception)
    that were thrown by these classes when one attempted to compute or
    use an 'invalid' value. These exceptions are no longer thrown.
    Instead, we now documented what value
    (usually 'null') is returned when one attempts to do operations on
    such a date/time class, which makes the behaviour more consistent
    with how Qt's equivalent classes behave.

<h2>Release 3.3.0 (April, 8 2013)</h2>

<p>
 This release focuses on a reorganization of Wt's theme
 infrastructure, with the objective of
 supporting <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Twitter's
 Bootstrap CSS framework</a> as a new theme. At the same time we've
 added a number of widgets for which Twitter Bootstrap provides
 styling.
</p>

<p>It is our intention to support the Bootstrap theme (or more
 specifically, the Bootstrap class names) alongside the themes we
 already supported (which are based on our own class names). Ignoring
 what Bootstrap brings, you should be able to upgrade to this release
 without too much trouble, although you may need to adapt some CSS
 stylesheets as we did reorganize a number of things which were
 required for Bootstrap and were a good idea for our own CSS
 stylesheets too.</p>

<h3>A) New classes:</h3>

<dl>
  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1WTheme.html">WTheme</a>,
    <a href="classWt_1_1WCssTheme.html">WCssTheme</a>,
    <a href="classWt_1_1WBootstrapTheme.html">WBootstrapTheme</a>,
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Theme support classes for Wt. The role of a theme is to:
    <ul>
      <li>Load the CSS stylesheets for a new session</li>
      <li>Annotate newly created widgets with appropriate style
      classes</li>
    </ul>
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1WDateEdit.html">WDateEdit</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Functionally almost the same as a WDatePicker, this class
    specializes WLineEdit and is thus a WFormWidget, making it much
    easier to use in WTemplateFormView.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1WLocale.html">WLocale</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    This class supports localization for number formatting and
    extends the simple localization support we had in the previous
    versions of Wt (which as only effect had the selection of
    a different language for the resource bundles). It's main
    added value of native C++ support for localization is that it
    also affects client-side handling and parsing of number values,
    i.e. in <a href="classWt_1_1WIntValidator.html">WIntValidator</a> and
    <a href="classWt_1_1WDoubleValidato.htmlr">WDoubleValidator</a>.
  </dd>
  
  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1WNavigationBar.html">WNavigationBar</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    A navigation bar styles a menu as a typical top-level bar
    (currently only styled in the Bootstrap Theme).
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1WPopupWidget.html">WPopupWidget</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    A base class to simplify the creation of popup widgets that
    typically assist in editing or provide circumstantial information
    for another widget.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1WSplitButton.html">WSplitButton</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    A split button, which combines a button and a popup menu
    (currently only styled in the Bootstrap Theme).
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1WToolBar.html">WToolBar</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    A button tool bar (currently only styled in the Bootstrap Theme)
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1Dbo_1_1backend_1_1MySQL.html">Dbo::MySQL</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    A MariaDB/MySQL backend for Wt::Dbo. This is based on the work
    from Paul Harrisson who maintained this backend so far outside the
    Wt distribution. The backend has been designed for MariaDB, but
    should work fine for MySQL as well.
  </dd>  
</dl>

<h3>B) Main improvements:</h3>

<dl>
  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1Mail_1_1Message.html">Mail::Message</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Added API support for additional SMTP headers.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1WDatePicker.html">WDatePicker</a>,
    <a href="classWt_1_1WSuggestionPopup.html">WSuggestionPopup</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    The setGlobalPopup() functionality has been deprecated and does no
    longer have any effect, since a new improved algorithm is being
    used to anchor the popup to the DOM which no longer requires this
    workaround.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1WDialog.html">WDialog</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Addition of a footer() method that returns a container for dialog
    footer elements, typically buttons.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1WFormModel.html">WFormModel</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Addition of a validator() function that returns the validator for
    a field set using setValidator(), 
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1WGLWidget.html">WGLWidget</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Support for binary transfers which avoids serialization and
    deserialization of floats to text.
  </dd>
  
  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1WPushButton.html">WPushButton</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    A push button can now act as a toggle button, using setCheckable()
    and related API (currently only styled in the Bootstrap Theme) and
    can be linked to a popup menu using setMenu().
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1WStackedWidget.html">WStackedWidget</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    When switching between current widgets, the stacked widget will
    now record and restore the current scroll position, providing a
    much improved user experience when using the stacked widget for
    the 'main' contents of an application.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1WStringListModel.html">WStringListModel</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Full support was added for storing data of all roles, lifting the
    requirement to use another model such as WStandardItemModel for
    simple MVC widgets like WComboBox or WSuggestionPopup simply to be
    able to store UserRole data.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1WTemplate.html">WTemplate</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Added a new standard function (Functions::block) which allows the
    definition and use of a macro block inside a placeholder, which is
    in particular useful for forms which have repetitive formatting
    for each field.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1WTemplateFormView.html">WTemplateFormView</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Several API improvements: A new setFormWidget() allows the
    definition of the form widget for editing a field which
    is a more useful alternative compared to reimplement
    createFormWidget(). It also allows the optional
    definition of functions to update the view/model values, which
    avoids the need for specializing updateViewField() and
    updateModelField() these latter two functions have been deprecated
    in favour of two new functions updateViewValue() and
    updateModelValue() which only update the value but not other
    aspects such as visibility, validation state, or messages.
  </dd>
  
  <dt>
    Built-in httpd improvements
  </dt>
  <dd>
    A redundant copy operation of the response generated and sent by
    Wt has been removed, using scatter-gather I/O implemented by
    boost::asio instead.
  </dd>
</dl>

<h3>C) Non-backwards compatible changes</h3>

<dl>
  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1WMenuItem.html">WMenuItem</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    While in previous version of Wt, this class was only a data class
    that held the information related to an item, in 3.3.0 we modified
    this so that this class represents the widget itself. If you were
    redefining protected methods to customize the widget
    (i.e. createItemWidget() and updateItemWidget()), then this will no
    longer work as expected. The new system should be easier to
    customize (since you can simply specialize WMenuItem itself).
    In addition, we've simplified the rendering of a menu item so that
    a redundant layer of spans (or div's) has been removed. It makes
    the menu more consistent with the way CSS designers expect a menu
    to rendered, and this was done (you can guess the theme of this
    release by now ?) to be compatible with bootstrap's CSS styles.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1WApplication.html">WApplication::locale()</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    This now returns a WLocale object instead of the string
    designation of the locale (which you can query by calling name())
    on the locale object.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1WCalendar.html">WCalendar</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    The markup for this class has changed, and thus customized CSS
    will need to be updated.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1WMenuItem.html">WPopupMenuItem</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    The popup menu item class has been merged with WMenuItem (and
    WPopupMenu is now a specialized WMenu). This should not have
    noticeable API changes, except for the changes in markup and CSS
    documented above.
  </dd>
  
  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1WTreeNode.html">WTreeNode</a>,
    <a href="classWt_1_1WTreeTable.html">WTreeTable</a>
    <a href="classWt_1_1WTreeView.html">WTreeView</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    The markup for tree rendering has been changed (to using nested
    unordered list instead of nested tables), and thus customized CSS
    will need to be updated. The only API consequence is that
    WTreeNode::labelArea() is no longer returning a WTableCell but
    instead a WContainerWidget.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1WTreeView.html">WTreeView</a>,
    <a href="classWt_1_1WTableView.html">WTableView</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Event handling (clicked(), doubleClicked(), ... ) has been
    generalized: events that are not generated on an item (but for
    example in empty space below the items) will now also
    generate these events, but then with an invalid model index.
    You may thus need to adapt current code to check whether the model
    index that is returned is valid.

<h2>Release 3.2.3 (November, 1 2012)</h2>

<p>
 This release contains mostly bug fixes and one new feature: a payment
 processing API.
</p>

<h3>A) New namespaces:</h3>

<dl>
  <dt>
    <a href="group__payment.html">Wt::Payment (payment handling)</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    This namespace contains services and back-end classes for dealing
    with online payment brokers. At the moment there is support for
    PayPal's Express Checkout service.
  </dd>
</dl>

<h3>B) Main improvements:</h3>

<dl>
  <dt>
    Layout improvements.
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      If you had massive trouble migrating to 3.2.2 because of the
      layout rewrite, then you'll appreciate the efforts we've made to
      make the layout algorithms in 3.2.3 much more robust and
      consistent.
    </p>
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1Dbo_1_1QueryModel.html">Dbo::QueryModel</a>:
    added a mechanism for stable row data.
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      A common nuisance when working with the QueryModel (which
      retrieves data from the database as needed), is that concurrent
      database modifications such as insertions of new data, may
      interfere with the model's mapping of rows to objects (this is
      in fact a common problem with most ORM's indeed). This mapping
      may be important, especially when you want to process the user's
      selection of one or more rows selected by the user, in e.g. a
      table view. We've added a mechanism to assure that one can
      request the model for data at a given row, which is guaranteed
      to be the same row that has been previously retrieved, using the
      stableResultRow() method. It works by default for simple queries
      (returning data from one table), but can be easily customized
      for more complex queries.
    </p>
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="namespaceWt_1_1Render.html">Render library:</a>
    improved support for %-based block sizes and table rendering
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      Support was added for %-based sizes for block widths and table
      cell widths. In addition, table rendering in Wt::Render has been
      improved to support repeating headers (&lt;thead&gt; sections)
      for multi-page tables, and explicit page breaks (using the css
      page-break-after/before properties).
    </p>
  </dd>

</dl>

<h3>C) Non-backwards compatible changes</h3>

<dl>
  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1Dbo_1_1backend_1_1Sqlite3.html">Dbo::backend::Sqlite3</a>
  </dt>

  <dd>
    <p>We've changed the implementation of the storage ISO8601AsText
    format for time stamps (datetime). In the new, corrected,
    implementation, we generate dates using 'T' as the separator
    between date and time (as mandated by ISO8601), while the old
    behaviour used a space ('&nbsp;') instead as the
    separator. Sqlite3 supports either format equally. This may
    however break some applications which use queries for an exact
    date (or a date comparison), as the results may be affected.
    </p>

    <p> The old behaviour is still available as PseudoISO8601AsText,
    which can be configured using
    <code>connection.setDateTimeStorage(Wt::Dbo::SqlDateTime,
    Wt::Dbo::backend::Sqlite3::PseudoISO8601AsText)</code>
    </p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<hr>

<h2>Release 3.2.2 (July, 23 2012)</h2>

<p>
 This release contains mostly bug and feature improvements, but
 also a rewrite of the layout managers in Wt (WBoxLayout and
 WGridLayout), and this comes with some changes in (in most cases
 previously undefined) behaviour.
</p>

<h3>A) New classes:</h3>

<dl>
  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1WSslInfo.html">WSslInfo</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Class containing information on a client-side certificate that may
    have been configured for a SSL connection, and which can be used
    for authentication (accessible from
    <a href="classWt_1_1WEnvironment.html">WEnvironment</a>).
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1Dbo_1_1weak__ptr.html">Wt::Dbo::weak_ptr</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    A weak variant of Wt::Dbo::ptr which is used to implement
    One-to-One relations (see also
    <a
    href="group__dbo.html#ga00a060d5f4764f673948989f21837548">Wt::Dbo::hasOne()
    </a>).
  </dd>

</dl>

<h3>B) Main improvements:</h3>

<dl>
  <dt>
    Rewrite of <a href="classWt_1_1WLayout.html">WBoxLayout, WGridLayout</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
    The layout managers have been reimplemented, to address various
    issues with the old implementation, including API (in particular the wonky
    side-effects of AlignTop | AlignJustify) inconsistencies and bugs.
    </p>

    <p>The new implementation no longer uses tables when JavaScript
    is available, but instead using JavaScript-based layout with
    absolute positioning. The table-based implementation is still kept
    for plain HTML sessions (and progressive bootstrap). The code now
    uses exactly the same layout logic for both horizontal and
    vertical layout (but giving precedence to horizontal layout) and
    should be much more consistent (and perhaps also more
    performant). However, because of the many complexities and
    problems with the old code (inconsistent behaviour), you may see
    issues while upgrading. Please see the "Non-backwards compatible
    changes" below for hints on how to deal with this.</p>

    user-defined path for the markers. A new role
    MarkserScaleFactorRole was added which allows overriding the

<h3>C) Non-backwards compatible changes</h3>

<dl>
  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1WLayout.html">WBoxLayout, WGridLayout</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    While migrating old code to this version, here are some tips:
    <ol>
      <li><p>Alignment flags</p>
      <p>Previously, specifying an alignment for a widget in a
      layout, or for the layout when set to a container, had a double
      meaning. Not only would it implement the given alignment but also
      revert to passively letting HTML layout decide the layout of the
      contents, and adjust the parent (layout respectively container)
      accordingly. This had all kinds of side effects such as not
      propagating the size of layout-size-aware widgets and quirks in
      the vertical alignment.</p>
      <p><a href="classWt_1_1WContainerWidget.html#aff9884c8efdf90974077e96bcb1701db">WContainerWidget::setLayout(layout, alignment)</a> has been
      deprecated and will be removed from a future release. This call
      was almost always used to let the parent container resize to fit
      the size of the contained children, instead of fitting children
      in the parent container. This behaviour is now
      automatically deduced based on an (empty) size of the parent
      container. In case this heuristic does not work, then setting a
      non-0 maximum size on the container using <a href="classWt_1_1WWebWidget.html#a9b83805a5b8090d296ae4b5939fc9d11">setMaximumSize()</a> will
      act as a trigger, with the added benefit that the parent will only
      be allowed to resize up to a specified maximum size.</p>
      <p>An alignment specified in
      <a href="classWt_1_1WBoxLayout.html#a7c1ec58e25d0b7add93f5f4342844db6">W(Box/Grid)Layout::addWidget(widget, stretch, alignment)</a> now
      purely affects the alignment but has no other side effects. The
      preferred and minimum sizes of a child widget or layout is now
      always taken into account.</p>
      </li>
      <li><p>Child item sizes</p>
      <p>The layout algorithm is now implemented entirely in
      JavaScript, and is more gentle when dealing with a combination
      of cells (or columns/rows) that have a stretch factor and others
      that don't. Previously, a minimum (or fixed) size would be used
      to layout items that do not have a stretch factor. This had for
      example as a consequence that a WText would be narrowed down to its
      minimum width by using word wrapping throughout. Now, the
      preferred size is used for a child item, and shrinking to a minimum
      size only if necessary.</p>
      <li><p>Progressive bootstrap</p>
      A layout in the first page of an application rendered using
      progressive bootstrap will no longer fully upgrade to a full
      JavaScript version, but will result in a hybrid (between
      table-based and JavaScript-based). If it doesn't work out as you'd
      expect, then you should reconsider the use of progressive bootstrap,
      or the use of a layout manager in your first page.

<h2>Release 3.2.1 (March 16, 2012)</h2>

<p>
  This release contains mostly bug and feature improvements.
</p>

<h3>A) New classes:</h3>

<dl>
  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1WFormModel.html">WFormModel</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    A model class for forms. These models are used in Wt::Auth as the
    basis for RegistrationModel and AuthModel, and allow a more
    straight-forward customization of the underlying behavior of these
    forms.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1WReadOnlyProxyModel.html">WReadOnlyProxyModel</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    A proxy model class which allows to share a source model
    read-only between multiple sessions.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1WTemplateFormView.html">WTemplateFormView</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    A WTemplate-based standard view implementation that works in conjunction
    with WFormModel.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1Auth_1_1AuthModel.html">Auth::AuthModel</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    A model that implements authentication logic.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1Auth_1_1FacebookService.html">Auth::FacebookService</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    An OAuth-2.0 based authentication service implementation for
    Facebook.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="namespaceWt_1_1Utils.html">Wt::Utils</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    This namespace contains a number of utility functions that we
    found useful in projects using Wt. They relate mostly to
    lower-level encoding and decoding functions: base64-, hex-, html-,
    and url-encoding/decoding.
  </dd>
</dl>

<h3>B) Main improvements:</h3>

<dl>
  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1WApplication.html">WApplication</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    A new method, WApplication::bind(), is useful in combination with
    WServer::post() to avoid posting to a method of a deleted object,
    leveraging the same life-time tracking as with signal connections.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="namespaceWt_1_1Render.html">Render library</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    A large number of performance improvements, especially for table
    layout and rendering.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1Chart_1_1WAxis.html">Chart::WAxis</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    DateScale and DateTimeScale axes have improved auto-configuration of
    limits and timesteps, now taking into account the resolution.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1Dbo_1_1Transaction.html">Dbo::Transaction</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    We've modified the default transaction outcome: a transaction will
    now automatically commit(), unless the transaction is being
    destroyed (goes out of scope) because an exception is being
    thrown, in which case the transaction will rollback(). Previously,
    an uncommitted transaction would always rollback() on destruction.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1Dbo_1_1ptr.html">Dbo::ptr</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Added a session() method, returning the session with which the
    session has been associated.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    Shipped SHA-1 implementation.
  </dt>
  <dd>
    We now ship a SHA-1 implementation with Wt and this thus relaxes
    the need for OpenSSL to implement WebSockets and
    Auth::SHA1HashFunction.
  </dd>
</dl>

<h3>C) Non-backwards compatible changes</h3>

<dl>
  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1WTextEdit.html">WTextEdit</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Due to backwards incompatibility of IE9, we now require the latest
    version of TinyMCE (3.5b1 or later).
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1Auth_1_1AuthWidget.html">Auth::AuthWidget</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    A number of API methods that configure and access the configuration
    were moved to the new Auth::AuthModel class which can be accessed from
    the widget using model().
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1Auth_1_1AbstractPasswordService_1_1AbstractStrengthValidator.html">Auth::AbstractPasswordService::AbstractStrengthValidator</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    The API was simplified to be less unorthodox: validate() now
    returns a Result that contains all the information for it.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1Http_1_1Client.html">Http::Client</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    We've changed the signature of the parseUrl() utility function to
    parse the URL into a URL structure instead of a collection of
    string parameters.
  </dd>
</dl>

<hr>

<h2>Release 3.2.0 (November 29, 2011)</h2>

<p>
  This release contains a number of new modules, as well as the usual
  batch of <a href="http://redmine.emweb.be/versions/show/13">bug
  fixes</a> and small feature improvements.
</p>

<p>
  In this release we also change the WValidator API in a way that it
  is likely to break existing applications.
</p>

<h3>A) New namespaces:</h3>

<dl>
  <dt>
    <a href="group__json.html">Wt::Json (JSON handling)</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    This namespace contains classes (Object, Value, Array) which map
    the JSON types in C++. It also contains a parser to deserialize
    JSON. A writer to serialize to JSON hasn't been added yet.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="group__mail.html">Wt::Mail (SMTP protocol)</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    This namespace contains a Client to send mail messages. It is
    currently offering only limited functionality w.r.t. SMTP protocol
    handling, but contains enough functionality to send standards
    compliant plain-text/HTML mails, with full support for unicode.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="group__auth.html">Wt::Auth (Authentication)</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <div>This namespace contains model and view classes for
      authentication. It implements password authentication using best
      practices, email verification, remember-me tokens, and provisions
      support for federated login with an implementation of OAuth 2.0
      for authentication using third party identity providers.</div>

    <div>We expect that the API may still evolve, especially with
      respect to OAuth 2.0 (which is a draft protocol), and its use
      for OpenID Connect, which is the main use case for OAuth within
      the authentication module.</div>
  </dd>
</dl>

<h3>B) New classes:</h3>

<dl>
  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1WException.html">WException</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    We have cleaned up the use of exceptions within Wt. We have
    converted numerous cases where an exception used to be thrown to
    error logging, if the exception was thrown to indicate an API
    problem. When the API problem is not resulting in a corrupt state,
    we now log the error instead of terminating the session. All other
    cases now use an exception that implements WException. This does
    not affect situations where a std::exception was advertised in the
    API.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1WIOService.html">WIOService</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <div>
      Previously, boost::asio was used only in the built-in httpd as a
      portable asynchronous I/O reactor implementation. We have now
      moved this into the Wt library itself, where it is now used
      instead of a dedicated thread pool for dispatching requests (and
      other server events), and where it is also used for asynchronous
      I/O by e.g. the Http::Client.
    </div>
    <div>
      The WIOService specializes a boost::asio::service, and integrates
      the thread pool that runs the service.
    </div>
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1WStringStream.html">WStringStream</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    This is a utility class that we have used since long in Wt. It is
    a more efficient replacement for std::stringstream, with mostly a
    compatible API (at least for our purposes). For our purposes it is
    typically a factor of two or more faster.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1Http_1_1Client.html">Http::Client</a>, 
    <a href="classWt_1_1Http_1_1Message.html">Http::Message</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <div>We have added an implementation of a Http(s) client. The client
    is intended for consuming web services in Wt, and handles GET or
    POST requests. It is not suitable (yet) for large responses, since
    it buffers the entire response internally.</div>
    <div>The client uses asynchronous I/O, using the WIOService that is
    found in the current WServer instance.</div>
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1Dbo_1_1backend_1_1Firebird.html">Dbo::Firebird</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <div>Lukasz Matuszewski contributed a Firebird backend
    implementation, thanks !</div>
  </dd>
</dl>

<h3>C) Main improvements:</h3>

<dl>
  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1WAbstractItemView.html">WAbstractItemView</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Added a setHeaderWordWrap() method which configures header text
    word wrapping, and changed setHeaderAlignment() so that it now
    allows to change both the horizontal and vertical alignment. This
    replaces the previously interwoven API for both features using the
    multiLine parameter in setHeaderHeight(), which has been
    deprecated. The rendering of the header items has been
    reimplemented, simplified, and cleaned up in the process, avoiding
    rendering problems on IE browsers.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1WApplication.html">WApplication</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Two new methods, deferRendering() and resumeRendering() can be
    used to defer the rendering phase in response to the current
    event-loop request. This is useful for situations where you are
    waiting for an asynchronous operation to complete, but want to
    handle this synchronously in the user-interface (i.e. blocking the
    interface until the operation completes). While this is not a good
    idea in general, it may be useful if you can guarantee that the
    event will arrive within an acceptable time (e.g. 1 second). This
    effectively stalls the response to the current request, but avoids
    blocking threads in the process.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1WDialog.html">WDialog</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Added setClosable(), which adds a close icon into the title bar.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1WFormWidget.html">WFormWidget</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    We have cleaned up the use of exceptions within Wt. We have
    converted numerous cases where an exception used to be thrown to
    error logging, if the exception was thrown to indicate an API
    problem. When the API problem is not resulting in a corrupt state,
    we now log the error instead of terminating the session. All other
    cases now use an exception that implements WException. This does
    not affect situations where a std::exception was advertised in the
    API.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1WLogger.html">WLogger</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <div>
      We have reorganized the logging within Wt. Internally, a number
      of macros are now used for logging, with as default
      implementation our own (simple) logger, but which can be
      redefined to use instead another logging framework of your
      choice, as some have rightfully requested.
    </div>
    <div>
      But we've also improved our logger so that it now can be
      configured to filter only certain information, based on type and
      scope. This is mostly useful for debugging and development of Wt
      itself, since it allows us to switch on debugging output, in a
      fine-grained way, in a debug build.
    </div>
    <div>Finally, a new global function has been added (Wt::log()) which
      selects an appropriate logger for logging and is more convenient
      than WApplication::log() which required an application instance.
    </div>
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1WTemplate.html">WTemplate</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <div>Arguments to bound functions are now parsed and passed to
      the resolveString() methods.</div>

    <div>Two new constructs have been added: conditions and
      functions. Conditions allow certain parts of a template to be
      skipped or included based on a bound condition. Functions are
      useful to automatically resolve certain variables, two built-in
      functions are implemented: one to resolve strings in a message
      resource bundle ("tr"), and another to resolve the id of a bound
      widget ("id").
    </div>
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1Dbo_1_1collection.html">Dbo::collection&lt;T&gt;</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    We've added front() methods that return the first element.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    Built-in httpd connector
  </dt>
  <dd>
    We have expanded the WebSockets implementation to cover newer
    versions of the WebSockets protocol (draft): next to 00, we now
    also support 07, 08 and 13 protocols (with draft-17 semantics).
  </dd>

  <dt>
    Configuration
  </dt>
  <dd>
    On UNIX-like platforms, and using the built-in httpd connector,
    SIGHUP is caught in the WServer::waitForShutdown() utility function,
    and the configuration file (wt_config.xml) is reread.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    Several security improvements
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <dl>
      <dt>DoS mitigation</dt>
      <dd>We have added two measures to prevent DoS attacks that try
	to exhaust the server by spawning sessions. This is in
	particular a risk when deploying using the progressive bootstrap
	method, since then a plain HTML session can be spawned with a
	single request.
	<ul>
	  <li>Plain sessions may be limited to constitute only a
	  fraction of the total number of sessions. This is configured
	  using the &lt;plain-ajax-sessions-ratio-limit&gt;
	  configuration option.</li>
	  <li>Ajax sessions need to confirm their "intelligence" by
	  solving a puzzle which requires them to properly parse the
	  (ever-changing) JavaScript and HTML.</li>
	</ul>
      </dd>
      <dt>Compromised session ID risk reduction</dt>
      <dd>
	A compromised session ID no longer can be used to hijack that
	session.
	<ul>
	  <li>A full page refresh (using the session ID to rerender
	    the current application state) is no longer allowed unless
	    both client IP address and user-agent are unchanged. To
	    still enable page refresh in this situation, you may
	    configure the use of a cookie which can be used to confirm
	    the original browser (although that cookie will not be
	    used for session tracking), using the
	    &lt;session-id-cookie&gt; setting.</li>
	  <li>
	    The session ID cannot be used to POST events to an Ajax
	    session, since these require proof of other ever-changing
	    context specific information, notably a pageId and ackId.
	  </li>
	</ul>
      </dd>
    </dl>
  </dd>

</dl>

<h3>D) Non-backwards compatible changes</h3>

<dl>
  <dt>
    Build options
  </dt>
  <dd>The HTTP_WITH_SSL option has been removed, and is now replaced
    by WT_WITH_SSL -- OpenSSL is now a dependency of Wt inherited by
    the httpd.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1WValidator.html">WValidator</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    We broke the validate() method, to return a new WValidator::Result
    instead of WValidator::State. The main improvement is that the
    validation may also return a text which contains information on
    why validation failed. This makes the API consistent with the
    client-side API, and obviously much more useful. It will break
    existing application that call validate() or have reimplemented
    validate() in a custom validation class.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1Test_1_1WTestEnvironment.html">WTestEnvironment</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    This class has moved to a pseudo-connector library
    (libwttest). This was needed to be able to use asynchronous I/O
    (such as Http::Client) in test cases, which rely on a WIOService
    furnished by a WServer instance.
  </dd>
</dl>

<h2>Release 3.1.11 (September 23, 2011)</h2>

<p>
  This release
  contains <a href="http://redmine.emweb.be/versions/show/12">many
  bug fixes</a> and a few new features.
</p>

<h3>A) New classes:</h3>

<dl>
  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1WLink.html">WLink</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    This class unifies the different link types used in Wt, in a
    single value class. Depending on the context, a link may refer to
    a URL, a resource, or an internal path. We've updated the API
    throughout to replace the function overloads for these different
    cases with a single usage of WLink, simplifying the API (but don't
    worry, we left the old methods, albeit deprecated).
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1WMediaPlayer.html">WMediaPlayer</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    A media player has been added which provides a unified framework
    for playing audio and video, and which deals with cross-browser
    issues (choosing a suitable implementation per browser). We've also
    renamed WHTML5Audio, WHTML5Video, and WHTML5Media to WAudio,
    WVideo and WAbstractMedia respectively (since well, everything
    will eventually be HTML5, no ?).
  </dd>
</dl>

<h3>B) Main improvements:</h3>

<dl>
  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1WResource.html">WResource</a>,
    <a href="classWt_1_1Http_1_1ResponseContinuation.html">Http::ResponseContinuation</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Currently, you can already stream the output of a big resource in
    little chunks, using a continuation to resume sending the next
    part. We've now added API methods
    (WResourceContinuation::waitForMoreData() and
    WResource::haveMoreData()) to allow a resource to suspend its
    response because it is currently lacking more data, to continue
    later when new data is available (and without tying up a thread).
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1WDialog.html">WDialog</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Added an option setResizable() which puts a resize handle in the
    bottom right corner.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1WPopupMenu.html">WPopupMenu</a>,
    <a href="classWt_1_1WPopupMenuItem.html">WPopupMenuItem</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Added a triggered() signal, and an option to automatically cancel
    the popup menu when the mouse leaves the menu (after a
    delay). We've also added the possibility to link a popup menu item
    with a WLink, and the option to make the item which has a submenu
    item also itself selectable.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    Dbo::Session
  </dt>
  <dd>
    The load() method has an additional, optional parameter, to force
    rereading the copy from the database.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    Dbo::collection&lt;C&gt;
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Added a count() method which uses a query to determine whether the
    collection contains an element.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    Test::WTestEnvironment
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Added dialogExecuted() and popupExecuted() methods which allow to
    interact with a reentrant eventloop from a test plan.
  </dd>
</dl>

<h3>C) Non-backwards compatible changes</h3>

The item data roles InternalPathRole and UrlRole have been removed,
and replaced by a LinkRole (which contains a WLink value instead).

<h3>D) Deprecated API</h3>

With the introduction of WLink, the following API is being deprecated
(although it can be argued that some of these may be kept for
convenience):

<ul>
  <li>
    WAbstractArea::setRef(): use WAbstractArea::setLink() instead.
  </li>
  <li>
    WAbstractArea::ref(): use WAbstractArea::link() instead.
  </li>
  <li>
    WAbstractArea::setResource(): use WAbstractArea::setLink() instead.
  </li>
  <li>
    WAbstractArea::resource(): use WAbstractArea::link() instead.
  </li>
  <li>
    WAnchor::setRef(): use WAnchor::setLink() instead.
  </li>
  <li>
    WAnchor::ref(): use WAnchor::link() instead.
  </li>
  <li>
    WAnchor::setResource(): use WAnchor::setLink() instead.
  </li>
  <li>
    WAnchor::resource(): use WAnchor::link() instead.
  </li>
  <li>
    WAnchor::setRefInternalPath(): use WAnchor::setLink() instead.
  </li>
  <li>
    WImage::setImageRef(): use WImage::setImageLink() instead.
  </li>
  <li>
    WImage::imageRef(): use WImage::imageLink() instead.
  </li>
  <li>
    WImage::setResource(): use WImage::setLink() instead.
  </li>
  <li>
    WImage::resource(): use WImage::link() instead.
  </li>
  <li>
    WStandardItem::setInternalPath(): use WStandardItem::setLink() instead.
  </li>
  <li>
    WStandardItem::internalPath(): use WStandardItem::link() instead.
  </li>
  <li>
    WStandardItem::setUrl(): use WStandardItem::setLink() instead.
  </li>
  <li>
    WStandardItem::url(): use WStandardItem::link() instead.
  </li>
</ul>

The following classes have been renamed, and the old name is being
deprecated:

<ul>
  <li>
    WHTMLMedia is now WAbstractMedia.
  </li>
  <li>
    WHTMLVideo is now WVideo
  </li>
  <li>
    WHTMLAudio is now WAudio
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Release 3.1.10 (July 8, 2011)</h2>

<p>
  This release contains a mix of new features and bug fixes 
</p>

<h3>A) New classes:</h3>

<dl>
  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1WAnimation.html">WAnimation</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    We have added support for animations to show or hide widgets (used
    in <a href="classWt_1_1WWidget.html#a66bdda41220267a8c7ff9865996e2675">WWidget::setHidden()</a>,
    and <a href="classWt_1_1WStackedWidget.html">WStackedWidget</a>). These
    animations will only be used when the browser supports CSS3
    animations (at the moment of writing that includes latest Firefox,
    Chrome and Safari releases).
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1WStreamResource.html">WStreamResource</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Dmitriy Igrishin factored this out of the WFileResource since most
    of its functionality (continuations, range support) could be
    generalized to streaming from a std::istream.
  </dd>
</dl>

<h3>B) Main improvements:</h3>

<dl>
  <dt>
    Allowing multiple WServer instances.
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Apparently for no good reasons at all, some singletons were still
    around which prevented you from instantiating
    multiple <a href="classWt_1_1WServer">application servers</a>. Now
    you can (but only using the built-in httpd) instantiate multiple
    servers side by side in the same process, which may server the
    same or different web applications over different ports. A feature
    example (<code>multiple_servers</code>) shows how that works.

      method will, if needed, enable re-encoding of &lt;a&gt; anchors
      which reference internal paths consistent with how in the
      current session internal paths need to be dealt with (which
      depends on whether the browser supports Ajax and HTML5 History).

<h2>Release 3.1.9 (April 7, 2011)</h2>

<p>
  This release contains mostly bug fixes and quality improvements.
</p>

<h3>A) New classes:</h3>

<dl>
  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1WAbstractSpinBox.html">WAbstractSpinBox</a>,
    <a href="classWt_1_1WDoubleSpinBox.html">WDoubleSpinBox</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Refactored and reimplemented the spinbox control into an integer
    and floating point version, which may be implemented either using
    a native HTML5 element or a portable Wt implementation.
  </dd>

</dl>

<h3>B) Main new features in existing classes:</h3>

<dl>
  <dt>
    Internal path handling: HTML5 History API
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <div>
      When the browser supports the HTML5 History API, URLs are now the
      same for plain HTML and Ajax-enabled session (i.e. without the '#'
      trick). This can improve load time and improves the
      user-experience.
    </div>

    <div>
      To avoid problems of resolving resources with relative URLs, a
      new property 'baseURL' can be used (that can be configured in
      wt_config.xml), which allows all relative URLs be resolved from
      the same location.
    </div>
  </dd>

  <dt>
    Internal path handling: no ugly internal paths ('?_=/path')
  </dt>
  <dd>
    The configuration option (--docroot) for the built-in
    httpd allows to specify folders with static paths and when doing
    so, all other requests are forwarded to the application, which in
    turn does no longer need to rely on the ugly '?_=' query parameter
    to encode its internal paths.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1WPdfImage.html">WPdfImage</a>, <a href="classWt_1_1WRasterImage.html">WRasterImage</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Improved font support: the library can be optionally built to use
    libpango for resolving characters to glyphs. This allows text to
    be rendered using a mix of different fonts that all provide only
    partial coverage for the entire unicode range. Note that for
    WPdfImage, this currently requires use of a libharu fork
    (https://github.com/kdeforche/libharu/tree/)
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1WAbstractItemView.html">WAbstractItemView</a>,
    WTableView and WTreeView
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Implementation of setRowHeaderCount() which fixes the number of
    columns that are used as row headers and remain fixed while
    scrolling horizontally through the table. This replaces the now
    deprecated setColumn1Fixed() API.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1WRasterImage.html">WRasterImage</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Several quality improvements: correct rendering of alpha
    compositing, text rendering by libpango, 
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1WSlider.html">WSlider</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    The slider has been reimplemented to allow for using either the
    native HTML5 slider control, or the Wt implementation. The Wt
    implementation can now also be styled through CSS.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1WServer.html#abca6890dab44d87bd3af64705ac072d3">WRun()</a>,
    <a href="classWt_1_1WServer.html#a84f84652ccb139850adcf5ea75f50fa5">WServer::addEntryPoint()</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    The callback function is now a boost::function<> object, allowing
    you to bind other variables into the callback function.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1WServer.html#a2894484a9661d728dc9aa60ba79bb570">WServer::post()</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    A safe method to post events to a session, and a useful
    alternative to WApplication::UpdateLock. The simplechat and
    codeview examples were converted to illustrate this method rather
    than the (dead-lock prone) WApplication::UpdateLock approach.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1WString.html#abcff7d3d30972762bd5d9279dc903a36">WString::trn()</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Implementation of plural string resolution, with locale-dependent
    rules. The implementation provided
    by <a href="classWt_1_1WMessageResourceBundle.html">WMessageResourceBundle</a>
    allows the same kind of expressions as GNU ngettext().
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1Chart_1_1WAxis.html#ab36cb584a0aa8bdcc1c3212a9304e6cd">Chart::WAxis::setResolution()</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Allows to specify the minimum chart axis resolution (contributed by Gaetano Mendola).
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1Dbo_1_1Transaction.html">Dbo::Transaction</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Fixed an issue with internal inconsistencies after transaction rollback.
  </dd>

</dl>

<h3>C) Non-backwards compatible changes</h3>

<dl>
  <dt>Changed i18n keys for <code>Wt.WDate.Mon-Sun</code>
  and <code>Wt.Date.Jan-Dec</code></dt>
  <dd>
    We were pointed out the fact that the built-in i18n keys for WDate
    month names had a collision for the month 'May', which had the
    same key for the abbreviated 3-letter variant as the full length
    variant. Therefore in this release we reformatted the abbreviated
    3-letter variant keys to <code>Wt.WDate.3.Mon-Sun</code>
    and <code>Wt.WDate.3.Jan-Dec</code>. You will need to update your own
    languages copies of these (or better, contribute them and we'll
    maintain them for you!).
  </dd>
</dl>

<h3>D) Android and iPad/iPhone targets</h3>

<p>This release contains initial work on supporting Android and
iPad/iPhone as targets for deploying Wt applications within a webkit
view widget.</p>

<p>For iPad/iPhone, we added a script that builds Wt as an OSX Framework
which may be used in XCode to build iOS applications.</p>

<p>For Android, we added support for building the library and examples as
shared objects which are packaged together with a small Java project
which instantiates a WebView, into standalone APK files.</p>

<p>This is ongoing work. We need to improve support in Wt for Mobile
Webkit to make the applications look and behave more as native
applications on these devices.</p>

  </dt>
  <dd>
    Added support for Right-To-Left (mirrored) layouts, typically used
    with some middle-Eastern languages. In addition to HTML's built-in
    support for RTL directionality, layout managers, tables and MVC
    tree/table views render their columns in the opposite order.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1WBoxLayout.html">WBoxLayout, WGridLayout, WBorderLayout</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Empty layout items do longer create padding, and thus padding
    collapses around empty items (both horizontally and vertically).

  </dt>
  <dd>
    Added support true type font loading, a UTF8 patch for libharu is
    pending to enable full unicode support text rendering.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1WWidget.html#afc4bfcc92fa39010cac8775f3332dfa5">WWidget::setWidth()</a>,

  <dd>
    Added mappings for C++ <code>bool</code> and <code>long</code> types.
  </dd>

</dl>

<h3>C) API and other changes:</h3>

<dl>
  <dt>
    CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)
  </dt>
  <dd>
    A communication method between browser and server is now chosen
    based on the needs (same origin or cross-origin), and based on
    browser support. Cross-Origin requests are now supported for both
    Ajax and WebSockets, and are are chosen if available and needed,
    reverting to dynamic script-tags otherwise.<br/>

    The WApplication::setAjaxMethod() has no effect anymore, and has
    been deprecated.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    Bootstrap process has changed.
  </dt>
  <dd>
    While tracking bootstrapping problems on IE8 (resulting in a blank
    page instead of a shiny app), we not only found a good workaround
    for that, but also found a way to implement the default bootstrap
    mode so that the stylesheets are applied before the application is
    rendered. This solves the annoying flicker you experienced with
    the default bootstrap mode, and also allows us to remove a number
    of workarounds for IE. As a result of various cleanups, more CSS
    stylesheet rules have been pushed out to the external wt.css
    (theme) stylesheet. If you've created your own theme, you will
    need to take note.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="group__painting.html#gaf67a889bc5e9f8ab3a59fe58b0fa2128">Wt::BrushStyle</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
     Wt::WBrushstyle has been renamed to Wt::BrushStyle. This makes it
     consistent with the naming conventions of other enums. Sorry, our
     mistake !

    WebSocket protocol support (experimental)

  <dd>Use of WebSocket for communication between browser and server
    can now be used, by enabling &lt;web-sockets&gt; in the
    configuration file (we're likely to turn this on by default in a
    future version. There is automatic fallback to the current
    XMLHttpRequest based communication if WebSockets are not available
    or communication could not be established. WebSockets is only
    available using the built-in httpd server (which is now also a
    WebSocket server).</dd>

<h2>Release 3.1.5 (Sep 10, 2010)</h2>

<p>
  This release contains mostly bug fixes.
</p>

<h3>A) Main Changes</h3>

<dl>
  <dt><a href="classWt_1_1WGridLayout.html">WGridLayout</a>,
    <a href="classWt_1_1WBoxLayout.html">WBoxLayout</a></dt>
  <dd>Optimized client-side rendering performance. Previously, every layout
    manager used would automatically slowdown every event because it would try
    to relayout each time. This is no longer the case.</dd>
  <dt><a href="classWt_1_1WSocketNotifier.html">WSocketNotifier</a></dt>
  <dd>The socket notifier has been resurrected (it was in a perpetual state
    of brokenness) and now works reliably across targets.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>B) Changes that may break existing applications:</h3>

<h4>1) Built-in resource bundles</h4>

Starting with this version, Wt uses an internal message resource
bundle for the few strings it provides by itself (like for example
'Ok' for the ok button in a WMessageBox, or the days-of-week in WDate).

Previously, an ugly API was used in <a href="classWt_1_1WMessageBox.html">WMessageBox</a>,
<a href="classWt_1_1WCalendar.html">WCalendar</a>,
and <a href="classWt_1_1WDatePicker.html">WDatePicker</a>
using a boolean 'i18n' parameter in the constructor. All this has now been removed,
and instead the keys for these built-in strings have been documented. If you were
using these classes your application will no longer build, you can simply remove the
internationalization parameter and you will need to fix the keys you used for the
messages according to the documentation.

Any localized strings you use will take precedence over these built-ins.

All affected classes (only those listed above actually have changed API and behaviour) are:
<dl>
  <dt><a href="classWt_1_1WAbstractItemView.html">WAbstractItemView</a></dt>
  <dd>the paging tool bar buttons for graceful callback.</dd>
  <dt><a href="classWt_1_1WCalendar.html">WCalendar</a></dt>
  <dd>because of WDate</dd>
  <dt><a href="classWt_1_1WDate.html">WDate</a> and <a href="classWt_1_1WDateTime.html">WDateTime</a></dt>
  <dd>week days, month names</dd>
  <dt><a href="classWt_1_1WDatePicker.html">WDatePicker</a></dt>
  <dd>because of WCalendar and for the close button</dd>
  <dt><a href="classWt_1_1WDefaultLoadingIndicator.html">WDefaultLoadingIndicator</a></dt>
  <dd>loading text</dd>
  <dt><a href="classWt_1_1WInPlaceEdit.html">WInPlaceEdit</a></dt>
  <dd>save and cancel button text</dd>
  <dt><a href="classWt_1_1WMessageBox.html">WMessageBox</a></dt>
  <dd>standard buttons</dd>
  <dt><a href="classWt_1_1WOverlayLoadingIndicator.html">WLoadingIndicator</a></dt>
  <dd>standard buttons</dd>
  <dt><a href="classWt_1_1WValidator.html">Validators</a></dt>
  <dd>for the messages they display in case of error</dd>
</dl>

<h4>2) Other behavioural changes</h4>

<dl>
  <dt><a href="structWt_1_1WDialog.html">WDialog</a></dt>
  <dd>Escape will no longer result in the dialog being rejected. You can
    enable this behaviour using the rejectWhenEscaped() method.
  </dd>
</dl>

<h2>Release 3.1.4 (Aug 13, 2010)</h2>

<p>
  This release contains several new features, but also a few changes
  that break backwards compatibility (but are unlikely to affect an

  </dt>
  <dd>Added an appRoot() method this returns the value of the
    special property "approot" which can in some cases be defined
    implicitly by a connector (such as ISAPI), and which allows an
    application to reference working files whereas previously it was
    assumed that they were in the working directory (CWD).</dd>

  </dt>
  <dd>Added support for row insertion/removal.</dd>

  button and ability to react to a selection.</dd>
  <dt>
    <a href="group__dbo.html#gc98c1f90b00ed9ce243c6412da3ac489">Dbo::id()</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>Support for natural keys (possibly of composite type) next to the
    built-in surrogate keys.</dd>
  <dt>
    <a href="structWt_1_1Dbo_1_1dbo__traits.html">Dbo::dbo_traits&lt;C&gt;</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>By specializing this traits class, you can modify the surrogate id
    field name (or disable it), and the optimistic version lock field
    name (or disable it).</dd>
  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1Dbo_1_1Session.html#8712ff0d59f7bb6a4d2986ad9637cc9e">Dbo::Session::query()</a>
  </dt>

  support for "select distinct".</dd>
  <dt>
    <a href="classWt_1_1Dbo_1_1QueryModel.html">Dbo::QueryModel</a>
  </dt>

<h3>C) Changes that break existing applications:</h3>

<dl>
  <dt><a href="structWt_1_1Dbo_1_1Dbo.html">Dbo::Dbo</a></dt>
  <dd>
    This class is now a templated with the class name itself, in
    order to provide the proper type for the (natural or surrogate) id
    field for id(). You will need to replace
    <pre>
      class User : public Wt::Dbo { ... }
    </pre>
    with
    <pre>
      class User : public Wt::Dbo&lt;User&gt; { ... }
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>CSS</dt>
  <dd>The toplevel container used by Wt is now given a <code>position:
    relative</code> style; this was needed to be able to position widgets
    (such as popups) using <code>position: absolute</code>, but may break
    application layouts. You can override this CSS style by adding
    <code>.Wt-domRoot { position: static; }</code> to your application's
    (internal or external) stylesheet.
  </dd>

<h3>D) Build changes:</h3>

<dl>
  <dt>XML_FEATURES</dt>
  <dd>This CMake option has been removed, and Mini-XML has been
    replaced by a modified RapidXML xml parser (mostly because of the
    hard-to-interpret Mini-XML license), but there are also nice
    performance improvements.</dd>
</dl>

<hr />

<h2>Release 3.1.0 (December 29, 2009)</h2>

<p>This release contains several new features and classes, after a long
  period of stabilization that happened before the 3.0.0 release.</p>

<h3>A) New classes:</h3>

<dl>
  <dt><a href="classWt_1_1WAggregateProxyModel.html">WAggregateProxyModel</a></dt>
  <dd>A model that provides support for drilling down through columns, supported
  by WTreeView.</dd>
  <dt><a href="classWt_1_1WCombinedLocalizedStrings.html">WCombinedLocalizedStrings</a></dt>
  <dd>Combines different localized strings implementations.</dd>
  <dt><a href="classWt_1_1WDateTime.html">WDateTime</a></dt>
  <dd>Combines a calendar date (WDate) and a clock time (WTime).</dd>
  <dt><a href="classWt_1_1WTemplate.html">WTemplate</a></dt>
  <dd>Use an XHTML fragment as a template, with variables that are place
  holders for strings or other widgets. See the blog example of how this
  class can be used to simplify HTML/CSS based layout of widgets and
  contents.</dd>
  <dt><a href="classWt_1_1WTime.html">WTime</a></dt>
  <dd>Represents a clock time (0-24 hours).</dd>
  <dt><a href="group__dbo.html">Wt::Dbo</a></dt>
  <dd>An Object Relational Mapping library. See the <a href="../../tutorial/dbo.html">tutorial here</a>.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>B) Main new features in existing classes:</h3>

Most inline CSS styles have been pushed out to an external style
sheet, which may be themed. The "default" theme provides the old look,
while a new "polished" theme provides a less boring (?) look for
several widgets (work in progress). The theme can be set using <a
href="classWt_1_1WApplication.html">WApplication::setCssTheme()</a>.

As a result, you will need to deploy Wt's <code>"resources/"</code>
folder, which contains the themes in <code>"resources/themes/"</code>, for
all but the most trivial applications.

<dl>
  <dt><a href="classWt_1_1Signal.html">Signal</a></dt>
  <dd>Added a template connect() method which may be given any function
  object, providing also support for the (future) c++1x lambda functions.</dd>
  <dt><a href="classWt_1_1WCanvasDevice.html">WCanvasDevice</a></dt>
  <dd>Several optimizations to output more concise JavaScript.</dd>
  <dt><a href="classWt_1_1WPaintedWidget.html">WPaintedWidget</a></dt>
  <dd>When width and/or height is not set using resize(), the widget
  will now properly react to layout management when put into a layout
  manager, triggering a server-side rerendering when needed.</dd>
  <dt><a href="classWt_1_1WSlider.html">WSlider</a></dt>
  <dd>A sliderMoved() signal was added which is fired whenever the slider is
  moved (but not yet released).</dd>
  <dt><a href="classWt_1_1WWidget.html">WWidget</a></dt>
  <dd>Added a find() method which searches the widget hierachy for a widget
  with a particular objectName().</dd>
  <dt><a href="classWt_1_1WServer.html">WServer</a></dt>
  <dd>Added an addResource() method to bind static resources to particular
  URLs (i.e. resources that are not bound to a specific session).</dd>
  <dt><a href="classWt_1_1Ext_1_1Container.html">Ext::Container</a></dt>
  <dd>Will now properly react to layout management from a layout that
  is set for a WContainerWidget.</dd>
  <dt><a href="classWt_1_1Ext_1_1FormField.html">Ext::FormField</a></dt>
  <dd>Added changed(), blurred() and focussed() signals.</dd>
  <dt><a href="classWt_1_1Chart_1_1WAxis.html">Chart::WAxis</a></dt>
  <dd>Added setAutoLimits() and autoLimits() methods to configure which limits
  are to be determined based on the data, and which are explicitly set.</dd>
  <dt><a href="classWt_1_1Chart_1_1WDataSeries.html">Chart::WDataSeries</a></dt>
  <dd>Added the setHidden() and hidden() methods to enable or disable
  a data series. Added setBarWidth() and barWidth() methods to set the
  width of a bar (useful mostly for scatter plots). Added
  setMarkerSize() and markerSize() methos.</dd>
  <dt><a
  href="classWt_1_1Chart_1_1WCartesianChart.html">Chart::WCartesianChart</a></dt>
  <dd>Use MarkerPenColorRole and MarkerBrushColorRole to override
  colors for makers on a per data point basis. Added mapFromDevice()
  and mapToDevice() methods for mapping device coordinates to chart
  coordinates and vice-versa</dd>
  </dl>

<h3>C) API Changes:</h3>

<dl>
  <dt><a href="classWt_1_1WSlider.html">WSlider</a></dt>
  <dd>Not really an API change, but the vertical slider is now showing
  the maximum value at its top side, not its bottom side.</dd>
  <dt><a href="classWt_1_1Chart_1_1WAxis.html">Chart::WAxis</a></dt>
  <dd>The minimum() and maximum() methods will now return the calculated
  minimum and maximum value when they are to be automatically calculated based
  on the data, configured using setAutoLimits()</dd>
</dl>

<h3>D) Build changes:</h3>

<dl>
  <dt>XML_FEATURES</dt>
  <dd>A new configuration option, XML_FEATURES, was added which allows the library to be built without MiniXML (and disabling fatures that require Mini-XML support). This configuration option is likely to be removed again in future versions.</dd>
  <dt>Documentation</dt>
  <dd>A <code>doc</code> directive was added, which uses doxygen and asciidoc tools
  to generate the reference documentation and tutorial.</dd>
  <dt>Tests</dt>
  <dd>Automated tests were added for non-interactive functionality,
  and are built by default.</dd>
</dl>

<hr />

<h2>Release 3.0.0 (November 3, 2009)</h2>

<p>
This release contains mostly bug fixes, build improvements and
documentation improvements compared to the latest pre-release
(2.99.5).
</p>

<p>
Most build improvements are related to finding the boost
libraries. Previously, Wt used a custom script, since CMake versions
&lt; 2.6 did not provide a good enough script for finding
boost. Starting with this release, when using CMake 2.6 or later, Wt
will use the script that comes with CMake. You can still fall back to
the script that comes with Wt, which is still used for older versions
of CMake, by defining one of the BOOST_COMPILER or BOOST_VERSION
variables.
</p>

<h3>A) New classes:</h3>

<i>No new classes</i>

<h3>B) Main new features in existing classes:</h3>

<dl>
  <dt><a href="classWt_1_1WDialog.html">WDialog</a></dt>
  <dd>It is now possible to have multiple modal dialogs, and nested
  recursive event loops.</dd>
  <dt><a href="classWt_1_1WWidget.html#e29fe35b633ec166f922419cd3ca9d96">
      WWidget</a></dt>
  <dd>The <samp>setDisabled()</samp> method moved up
  from <samp>WFormWidget</samp> to <samp>WWidget</samp>.</dd>
  <dt><a href="classWt_1_1JSlot.html#3d65b00a8015e556580527b52750ef87">
      JSlot</a></dt>
  <dd>The <samp>exec()</samp> method now passes object and event to the
    JavaScript event handler.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>C) API Changes:</h3>

<dl>
  <dt><a href="classWt_1_1WResource.html">WResource</a></dt>
  <dd>The handling of changes to the resource has been sanitized. A
  new method, <samp>setChanged()</samp> was added which must be called
  to notify users of the resource that the resource was changed. In
  addition to the existing <samp>generateUrl()</samp> which generates
  a new URL, a method was added which merely returns the existing
  URL: <samp>url()</samp>. With these improvements, a resource can
  effectively be shared by many view widgets and updated with the
  minimum of bandwidth usage.</dd>
</dl>

<hr />

<h2>Release 2.99.5 (September 1, 2009)</h2>

<p>
This release contains mostly bug fixes. The previous release (2.99.4)
contains some critical bugs that cause mayhem on IE, and a regression
with server push.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Release 2.99.4 (August 27, 2009)</h2>

<p style="text-align: center">
  <b>!! This release contains bugs that render it unusable on IE !!</b>
</p>

<p>
This release contains mostly bug fixes and back-end improvements. The
most exciting new feature is the addition of a new bootstrap method,
which implements progressive enhancements (starting with a plain HTML
page, and then upgrading it to an AJAX page if the browser has
support), see
also <a href="/wt/doc/reference/html/overview.html#progressive_bootstrap">the
documentation</a>.
</p>

<h3>A) New classes:</h3>

<dl>
  <dt><a href="classWt_1_1WTableView.html">WTableView</a></dt>
  <dd>This is a simple MVC View class that renders tabular data
    in the most straight forward way using an HTML table element
  </dd>
</dl>

<h3>B) Main new features in existing classes:</h3>

<dl>
  <dt><a href="classWt_1_1Ext_1_1ToolBar.html#931b9b3e5d4cbbdee5394a841752c849">Ext::ToolBar</a></dt>
  <dd>Added insert() methods.</dd>
  <dt><a href="classWt_1_1WApplication.html#78016406c4746c56b2c2ffce7c5e181f">WApplication</a></dt>
  <dd>Added an enableAjax() method which notifies the application that
    a session is being enhanced with AJAX capabilities when using the
    progressive bootstrap method.</dd>
  <dt><a href="classWt_1_1WWidget.html#919a4eaf68ff52f06f6a726d55dfb768">WWidget</a></dt>
  <dd>Added an enableAjax() method which enhanced the widget with AJAX
    capabilities when using the progressive bootstrap method.</dd>
  <dt><a href="classWt_1_WCssDecorationStyle.html">WCssDecorationStyle</a></dt>
  <dd>Add support for custom cursors.</dd>
  <dt><a href="classWt_1_WWServer.html">WServer</a></dt>
  <dd>For FastCGI deployments, the proxy process which directs FastCGI
  requests to the correct session process is now also
  multi-threaded.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>C) API Changes:</h3>

<dl>
  <dt>The <a href="classWt_1_1WApplication.html#4a6f167bea94aefa8ba24f914c2fbee5">WApplication::notify()</a> behavior changed.</dt>
  <dd>Previously during a request, this method was called multiple
  times during event propagation and rendering of the
  application. Now, the method is called exactly once for each
  request. In this way, it becomes a useful entry point to also manage
  resource usage during (and inbetween) requests.</dd>
</dl>

<hr />

<h2>Release 2.99.3 (July 24, 2009)</h2>

<p>
This release contains mostly bug fixes and small feature
improvements. The most notable change that might affect existing
applications is a simplified internal path API behavior.
</p>

<h3>A) New classes:</h3>

<dl>
  <dt><a href="classWt_1_1WAbstractItemDelegate.html">WAbstractItemDelegate</a>
    and <a href="classWt_1_1WItemDelegate.html">WItemDelegate</a></dt>
  <dd><samp>WAbstractItemDelegate</samp> is a helper class used
    by <samp>WTreeView</samp> (and in the future perhaps other view
    classes) to render contents. The standard
    implementation, <samp>WItemDelegate</samp> maintains the default
    implementation that was previously integrated
    in <samp>WTreeView</samp>. The delegate will be responsible for
    editing features in <samp>WTreeView</samp> in the future, and in
    fact, you can already implement a custom item delegate that does
    editing if you cannot wait for it!
  </dd>
  <dt><a href="classWt_1_1Test_1_1WTestEnvironment.html">Test/WTestEnvironment</a></dt>
  <dd><samp>WTestEnvironment</samp> is an environment class which is useful for
    (unit) test-cases: it allows the instantiation of a
    <samp>WApplication</samp> so that you may include widgets in unit tests.
  </dd>
</dl>

<h3>B) Main new features in existing classes:</h3>

<h3>C) API Changes:</h3>

<dl>
  <dt>change of WApplication::internalPathChanged() semantics.</dt>
  <dd>The old behavior was that a single internal path change caused
  by the user (e.g. by moving forward/backword through his browser
  history) would cause repetitive invocations of internalPathChanged()
  with different arguments. The underlying idea was that this would
  make it easier to have the handling of internal path changes
  distributed over different objects. It caused however more problems
  than it solved. The new behavior is now that it is invoked exactly
  one time, and the argument is simply the new internal path.</dd>
</dl>

<hr />

<h2>Release 2.99.2 (May 29, 2009)</h2>

<p>
This release contains mostly build improvements, bug fixes, and API cleanups.
</p>

<h3>A) New classes:</h3>

<dl>
  <dt><a href="classWt_1_1Http_1_1Client.html">Http/Client</a></dt>
  <dd><samp>Client</samp> is a utility class to bootstrap a new Wt
  application.</dd>

  <dd>Add setFocus() method.</dd>
  <dt><a href="classWt_1_1Ext_1_1ToolBar.html">Ext::ToolBar</a></dt>
  <dd>Added an addStretch() method (contributed by David Galicia).</dd>

  <dd>Added a continuation() method.</dd>
  <dt><a href="classWt_1_1WCheckBox.html">WCheckBox</a></dt>

  <dd>Support for non-modal dialogs and interactive moving.</dd>
  <dt><a href="classWt_1_1WFormWidget.html">WFormWidget</a></dt>
  <dd>New methods setReadOnly() and isReadOnly().</dd>
  <dt><a href="classWt_1_1WGridLayout.html">WGridLayout</a></dt>
  <dd>Support a row stretch value of -1, which is like 0 but will still
  manage the height of cells (allowing their contents to fill the entire
  cell).</dd>
  <dt><a href="classWt_1_1WPaintDevice.html">WPaintDevice</a></dt>
  <dd>Support update rendering (not erasing the current canvas) using
  paint flags.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>C) API Changes:</h3>

<dl>
  <dt>WFileUpload::isUploaded() was deprecated</dt>
  <dd>The name was not covering its actual behavior: instead of
  checking whether a file has been uploaded, it returns whether true
  when a call to upload() is not needed. You should replace any call
  to isUploaded() with the new method
  <a href="classWt_1_1WFileUpload.htm#66376fb4668a037760a91abad9f83f8al">!canUpload()</a> (<b>note the inversion!</b>.</dd>

<h2>Release 2.99.1 (Mar 20, 2009)</h2>

<p>
This release contains only build improvements, bug fixes, and API cleanups.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Release 2.99.0 (Mar 4, 2009)</h2>

<p>
This release is a preview for Wt 3.0.0. Many things have changed both
in the internals and the API. This is the first release that provides
several API changes which are not backward compatible (some of which
were post-poned until now).

Please read the following notes carefully, especially sections C) and
D), to understand what changes to expect and how to adapt existing
applications.
</p>

<p>
Support for the C++ boost library &lt; 1.35 has been dropped: Wt now
requires at least boost >= 1.35.0.
</p>

<h3>A) New classes:</h3>

<dl>
  <dt><a href="classWt_1_1WFlags.html">WFlags</a></dt>
  <dd><samp>WFlags</samp> is a utility class that provides a type-safe ORing of
  enum flags. It is used everywhere in the Wt API where previously an
  <samp>int</samp> was used to allow enums to be ORed together.</dd>
  <dt><a href="classWt_1_1WGoogleMap.html">WGoogleMap</a></dt>
  <dd>This is a widget, contributed by Richard Ulrich, that displays a
  Google map.</dd>
  <dt><a href="classWt_1_1Http_1_1Request.html">Http::Request</a>, <a href="classWt_1_1Http_1_1Response.html">Http::Response</a>, <a href="classWt_1_1Http_1_1ResponseContinuation.html">Http::ResponseContinuation</a> and <a href="classWt_1_1Http_1_1UploadedFile.html">Http::UploadedFile</a></dt>
  <dd>These are utility classes which model an HTTP request and
  response and that are used in the new <samp>WResource</samp> API.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>B) Main new features in existing classes:</h3>

<dl>
  <dt><a href="classWt_1_1WApplication.html#d9631ca64e68d30d40cb49c90e55223d">WApplication::enableUpdates()</a></dt>
  <dd>Server-initiated updates (aka "server push") has been
  reimplemented and now works reliably in all situations, including in
  the presence of intermediate proxies. The dependency on the 3rd
  party JS orbited library has been removed and replaced with a simple
  XHR-based solution.</dd>
  <dt><a href="classWt_1_1WButtonGroup.html">WButtonGroup</a></dt>
  <dd>Various methods were added: id's may be associated with a specific
  radio buttons, which may be used to identify a particular button.</dd>
  <dt><a href="classWt_1_1WDatePicker.html">WDatePicker</a></dt>
  <dd>Is now easier to use because of a sensible default constructor
  that also creates the line edit using a <samp>WDateValidator</samp>,
  and creates the icon which is associated with the popup.</dd>
  <dt><a href="classWt_1_1WFileResource.html">WFileResource</a></dt>
  <dd>Uses the continuation support in the new <samp>WResource</samp> API
  to transmit the file in chunks.</dd>
  <dt><a href="classWt_1_1WLength.html">WLength</a></dt>
  <dd>WLength::Auto was added, is a synonym for WLength()</dd>
  <dt><a href="classWt_1_1WSuggestionPopup.html">WSuggestionPopup</a></dt>
  <dd>Is now also an MVC View widget, reading its data from a
  <samp>WAbstractItemModel</samp></dd>
  <dt><a href="classWt_1_1WTable.html">WTable</a></dt> <dd>New method
  setHeaderCount() to specify the number of first rows or columns that
  should be rendered as an HTML table header
  (<samp>&lt;th&gt;</samp>).</dd>
  <dt><a href="classWt_1_1WWidget.html">WWidget</a></dt>
  <dd><p>New virtual method <samp>rerender()</samp> which allows a
  widget to prepare itself before rendering (and defer internal
  changes until that time). A widget may ask to be rerendered using
  <samp>askRerender()</samp></p> <p><samp>Widget</samp> no longer
  inherits from <samp>WResource</samp>, but instead inherits directly from
  <samp>WObject</samp>. It was simply a bad idea, and not useful for
  anything.</p></dd>
</dl>

<h3>C) Changes that break existing applications:</h3>

<dl>
  <dt>1) Signals are no longer public members</dt>
  <dd><p>Instead, they are now accessor member functions:
  e.g. <samp>WInteractWidget::clicked</samp> has been renamed to
  <samp>WInteractWidget::clicked()</samp>. This has as major benefit
  that signals can be created on-demand, which leads to drastically
  lower memory usage and significant speedups especially on embedded
  systems.</p> <p>The change requires that everywhere in your code
  where you access a signal, you will need to change to add
  parentheses. For consistency, you may also want to
  use the same convention for your own widget classes that define
  signals.</p></dd>
  <dt>2) <a href="classWt_1_1WResource.html">WResource</a></dt>
  <dd><p>The API has been redesigned and greatly simplified. If you are
  implementing your own resources, then you will need to redesign your
  implementation. The new API is simpler (requires only one virtual
  method to be implemented) and more powerful, providing support for
  <i>continuations</i> to serve large resources without blocking a
  thread or requiring large memory usage.</p>
  <p>In addition, resources have better thread-safety: they are now by
  default reentrant (requests for a single resource may be handled
  concurrently) and they are protected from concurrently being
  destroyed by the main event loop.</p></dd>
  <dt>3) <a href="classWt_1_1WValidator.html">WValidator</a></dt>
  <dd><p>The signature for the virtual <samp>validate()</samp> method was
  changed: parameter <samp>pos</samp> which was ignored anyway has
  been removed.</p></dd>
  <dt>4) <a href="classWt_1_1WEnvironment.html">WEnvironment</a></dt>
  <dd><p>The methods <samp>getArgument()</samp> and
  <samp>arguments()</samp> were renamed to respectively
  <samp>getParameter()</samp> and <samp>getParameterMap()</samp>. The
  signature for <samp>getParameter()</samp> is also different as it
  returns a pointer to a string, which is 0 when the parameter is not
  defined, instead of the olde behaviour of throwing an
  exception. There is a new method that allows to read all values for
  a parameter, <samp>getParameterValues()</samp></p></dd>
  <dt>5) <a href="classWt_1_1ModelIndex.html">WModelIndex</a></dt>
  <dd><p>The 20-byte SHA1 hash based internal pointer has been removed
  again as the object increase and overhead could not be justified.</p></dd>
</dl>

<h3>D) Deprecated API that was removed:</h3>

These are API calls that were deprecated in earlier releases, and have now
been completely removed from the library:

<dl>
  <dt><samp>WApplication::applicationName()</samp></dt>
  <dd>Use <a

</dl>

<h3>C) Changes that break backward compatibility</h3>

<p>This release does not contain changes that break existing
applications.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Release 2.2.1 (Nov 3, 2008)</h2>

<p>This release is as usually a mix of bug fixes, improvements and new
features.</p>

<p>We have made a significant change to the MVC system, which will
break existing program code in case you have implemented your own
models (i.e. deriving from <samp>WAbstractItemModel</samp>) or views
widgets (i.e. components that listen to model changes).</p>

<p>
The <samp>WAbstractItemModel</samp> interface was changed to support
hierarchical models. This means that most methods will now take an
extra parameter that specifies the parent <samp>WModelIndex</samp>,
and also all signals have now this extra parameter. Because the
parameter has a default value of WModelIndex() which corresponds to
the top level parent, the API is largely backwards compatible when
merely using the model. It is only those classes that reimplement the
interface, or listen to signal events, that are affected.
</p>

<p>
The immediate benefit of the new <samp>WAbstracItemModel</samp>
interface is that it allows us to implement View widgets like the new
<samp>WTreeView</samp> widget.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Release 2.2.0 (Sept 12, 2008)</h2>

<p>This release has a rather substantial rewrite (and simplification)
of Wt's bootstrapping process. In the past, Wt used a frameset trick
to be able to load the AJAX-based skeleton when JavaScript was
available. Instead, now, the entire AJAX-based stuff is loaded
directly into the bootstrap page. A benefit of the new approach is
that we avoid iframe tricks, which have been deprecated from strict
HTML and XHTML. But, it was in fact motivated in the first place to
support all major browsers for a new internal path API. This new API
allows to fully support URL changes and bookmarks in a unified way
(i.e. it works equally when the browser supports AJAX, no JavaScript,
or is a bot such as google bot).</p>

<p>As a consequence, this release contains the following changes that
may break your application:</p>

<ul>
  <li><samp>WMenu::enableBrowserHistory()</samp> and <samp>WMenu::browserHistoryId()</samp> have been removed, use the new methods <samp>WMenu::setInternalPathEnabled()</samp> and <samp>WMenu::setInternalBasePath()</samp>
  </li>
  <li><samp>WMenuItem</samp> has been reorganized, and if you have
  specialized WMenuItem you will need to adapt your reimplementation
  to the new virtual interface. In the new interface, you need to
  reimplement <samp>WMenuItem::createItemWidget()</samp> and
  <samp>WMenuItem::updateItemWidget()</samp> allowing you to react to
  item changes (internal path or text). The default implementation now
  always uses a WAnchor.</li>
  <li><samp>WApplication::setState()</samp>, <samp>WApplication::state()</samp> and <samp>WApplication::stateChanged</samp> have been deprecated. It is strongly advised that you use the new internal path API instead. This does require you to treat different parts of the state as a file hierarchy. See the <samp>WApplication::setInternalPath() documentation</samp>.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  The following methods have been deprecated (but are still supported):
</p>
<ul>
  <li><samp>WTable::numRows()</samp> has been renamed
  to <samp>WTable::rowCount()</samp>.</li>
  <li><samp>WTable::numColumns()</samp> has been renamed
  to <samp>WTable::columnCount()</samp>.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>Release 2.1.5 (July 25, 2008)</h2>

<p>Wt now installs its include files in a Wt/ subdirectory. You may
want to change your build files to pick up this new include directory,
or, change your code to scope the include files to look like
#include&lt;Wt/WLineEdit&gt; instead of #include&lt;WLineEdit&gt;</p>

<p>This release contains the following changes that may break your
application:</p>

<ul>
  <li><samp>WText</samp> will validate XHTML text when it is set to the
   widget. The old behaviour was to validate only before
   rendering. The change was needed to be able to react to XML parse
   errors. As a consequence if you are creating a WText with text that
   is not valid XML, followed by a
   call <samp>setFormatting(WText::PlainFormatting)</samp>, you should
   change this now to use the new <samp>WText</samp> constructor which
   takes the TextFormat as a new argument: <samp>new WText(text,
   Wt::PlainText, parentWidget)</samp>
  </li>
  <li><samp>WContainerWidget::setLayout(WLayout *layout, bool fitWidth, bool
   fitHeight)</samp> has been replaced with the more generic
   <samp>WContainerWidget::setLayout(WLayout *layout, int
   alignment)</samp>.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  The following methods and enumerations have been deprecated (but are
  still supported):
</p>
<ul>
  <li><samp>enum WText::Formatting</samp> has been renamed
  to <samp>Wt::TextFormat</samp>. The old values map as follows on new
  values:
    <ul>
      <li><samp>WText::XHTMLFormatting</samp> becomes <samp>Wt::XHTMLText</samp>;</li>
      <li><samp>WText::XHTMLUnsafeFormatting</samp> becomes <samp>Wt::XHTMLUnsafeText</samp></li>
      <li><samp>WText::PlainFormatting</samp> becomes <samp>Wt::PlainText</samp></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><samp>WText::setFormatting()</samp> has been renamed
  to <samp>WText::setTextFormat()</samp> and
  <samp>WText::formatting()</samp> has been renamed
  to <samp>WText::textFormat()</samp>.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>Release 2.1.4 (July 4, 2008)</h2>

<p>The following has changed for building Wt:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The CMake variable CONFIGURATION (which defaulted to
  /etc/wt/wt_config.xml) is no longer used, but instead there is now a
  CONFIGDIR (/etc/wt/) which is used to store configuration
  files.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The following has changed in the wt_config.xml file:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The &lt;valgrind-path&gt; setting for the FCGI connector may now
    be a command-line including arguments</li>
</ul>

<p>This release should not contain changes that may break your
application.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Release 2.1.3 (May 20, 2008)</h2>

<p>This release should not contain changes that may break your
application.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Release 2.1.2 (April 14, 2008)</h2>

<p>The following changes may break your application build:</p>

<ul>
  <li><samp>WTreeNode::expanded()</samp> has been renamed
  to <samp>WTreeNode::isExpanded()</samp>.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>Release 2.1.1 (April 10, 2008)</h2>

<p>This release should not break any of your applications, but we did
 deprecate some methods and enumeration types. You are advised to
 migrate to the replacements methods since we will discontinue support
 for the older ones in the future.</p>

<p>
  The following methods and enumerations have been deprecated:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><samp>enum SelectionUnit</samp> has been renamed
  to <samp>SelectionBehavior</samp>. The old values map as follows on new
  values: <samp>CellSelection</samp> becomes <samp>SelectItems</samp>;
    <samp>RowSelection</samp> becomes <samp>SelectRows</samp>.</li>
  <li><samp>WWidget::setOffset(int sides, WLength)</samp> is deprecated,
  and the new method is <samp>WWidget::setOffsets(WLength, int
  sides)</samp>: the argument order has been switched to be consistent
  with the method signature of <samp>setMargin()</samp>
  and <samp>setPadding()</samp>.</li>
  <li><samp>WResource::suggestFilename()</samp> has been renamed to
  <samp>WResource::suggestFileName()</samp>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  The following changes affect run-time behaviour:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><samp>WTreeNode</samp> now supports a policy for when to show a child count
  indication. The old behaviour was to always show the child count.
  Now, by default this option is disabled. Use
  <samp>WTreeNode::setChildCountPolicy(Enabled)</samp> to get the old
  behaviour back, if you wish.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>Release 2.1.0</h2>

<p>The library dependencies have changed slightly.</p>

<p>
To build Wt 2.1.0, you need:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>CMake 2.4 or later</li>
  <li>boost 1.34.1 (boost 1.33.1 might should still work, but is
    not recommended)</li>
  <li>asio 0.3.9: either the boost or non-boost version <i>(only
      for the http connector)</i></li>
  <li><i>optionally</i>, openssl for HTTPS support <i>(only for the http
      connector)</i></li>
  <li><i>optionally</i>, libz for gzip compression support <i>(only for
      the http connector)</i></li>
  <li>fcgi library, including C++ bindings (libfcgi++)<i>(only for the
      fcgi connector)</i></li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, the Wt::Ext library has been upgraded and now wraps
around the extjs 2.x library, instead of extjs 1.x.</p>

<p>Some API changes may need a porting effort:
</p>
  <ul>
    <li><samp>Ext::ProgressDialog</samp>: doesn't show by default, you
    need to call show() to show the dialog.</li>
    <li><samp>Ext::ContentPanel</samp>, <samp>Ext::BorderLayout</samp> have
    been removed. They have been replaced with a stand-alone layout
    system, that may manage contents in
    an <samp>Ext::Container</samp>. The layout system provides
    <samp>WBorderLayout</samp> and several other layout managers.</li>
    <li><samp>WSignalMapper</samp> has been expanded to allow mapping of
      signals with an extra argument, which is passed to the mapped
      signal. Because of this, the signature of the class has been
      expanded with an extra template argument. If you have forward
      declarations to <samp>WSignalMapper</samp>, you will need to modify
      these too (or simply include <samp>WSignalMapper</samp>).</li>
    <li><samp>WAnchor</samp>: no longer uses a <samp>WLabel</samp> internally,
      and the label-related methods have been removed.</li>
  </ul>

<hr />

<h2>Release 2.0.5</h2>

<ul>
  <li><samp>WDialog</samp> (and <samp>WMessageBox</samp>) usage changed, and
    is now more like Qt. When you are not
    using <samp>WDialog::exec()</samp> or <samp>WMessageBox::show(...)</samp>,
    then you must explictly <samp>show()</samp> the dialog to show it. You
    can now also <samp>hide()</samp> the dialog if you want.
  </li>
  <li>
    Moved several enums from within classes to the Wt namespace. This is
    likely to break your code at compile time when you are using one. The
    fix is to remove the class scope from the enum type or value.
    <ul>
      <li><samp>WScrollArea::Orientation</samp> -> <samp>Wt::Orientation</samp></li>
      <li><samp>WMenu::Orientation</samp> -> <samp>Wt::Orientation</samp></li>
      <li><samp>WMessageBox::StandardButton</samp> -> <samp>Wt::StandardButton</samp></li>
      <li><samp>WMessageBox::Icon</samp> -> <samp>Wt::Icon</samp></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>Release 2.0.4</h2>

<i>Important: 2.0.4a contains a fix for a bug introduced in 2.0.4 that
  reset the deploy-path in wthttpd.</i>

<p>
  This release adds a few new features:
</p>
  <ul>
    <li><samp>WComboBox</samp> (and <samp>WSelectionBox</samp>) now use
      a <samp>WAbstractItemModel</samp> in a more flexible model/view
      system.</li>
    <li>Stylesheets may be browser-conditional (by Patrick Fischer)</li>
    <li>wthttpd may serve custom error pages (by Patrick Fischer)</li>
    <li><samp>WResource</samp> can now access HTTP GET or POST query
      arguments. This will break your code (at compile time) if you
      have implemented your own <samp>WResource</samp>, since the signature of the
      <samp>streamResourceData()</samp> method has been changed to pass
      the arguments map as a second parameter.</li>
  </ul>

<hr />

<h2>Release 2.0.1</h2>

<p>
  This release fixes some build-related problems, as well as smaller
  bugs. The main improvement in this release is related to use of Wt
  in resource-constrained embedded systems.
</p>

<p>
  The most visible change is that the dependency on the Xerces C++ XML
  library was dropped in favour of the much smaller Mini-XML
  library. The draw-back is a reduction of supported character
  encodings to only UTF8 and UTF16, next to the default locale character
  encoding (which is typically an 8-bit flavour).
</p>

<p>
  When using the built-in httpd, you can now disable support for SSL
  at compile time, freeing a number of SSL-related dependencies.
</p>

<p>
  In the API, more comparison operators (== and !=) were added to
  WString, and a WViewWidget was added for simple MVC widgets (with
  the main purpose to reduce session-state at the server).
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Release 2.0.0</h2>

<p>
  This release contains numerous changes which are likely to cause some
  porting effort for Wt 1.1.x applications to work properly.
</p>

<p>
<b>If you are upgrading from a 1.99.x release, you will notice that
some of these notes have actually evolved, especially with respect to
WString and unicode support.</b>
</p>

<p>
  Here is a list of changes with respect to Wt 1.1.x that are likely
  to require your attention, and some tips on how to do the porting.
</p>

<h4>1) Namespace Wt</h4>

<p>All Wt classes are now inside the namespace <samp>Wt</samp>.</p>

<p>To handle this change, you will need to:
</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Wrap forward declarations to Wt widgets in header files inside a
      Wt namespace, or <samp>#include &lt;WFwdDeclarations&gt;</samp></li>
    <li>and scope all Wt classes with <samp>Wt::</samp>, </li>
    <li>or import the Wt namespace: <samp>using namespace Wt;</samp></li>
  </ul>

<h4>2) WString</h4>

<p>
  Previously, most widgets offered double methods that either used a
  <samp>std::string</samp> for literal text, or a
  <samp>WMessage</samp> for localized text.
</p>

<p>
  In the new release, widgets use <samp>Wt::WString</samp> for both
  literal and localized text. WString offers unicode support for both
  literal as well as localized text. To create a literal string,
  simply assign or construct a Wt::WString from that string. The
  strings supported or both narrow and wide C and C++ strings. UTF8
  encoded narrow strings may also be converted. To create a localized
  string, use one of the static methods <samp>WString::tr(const
  std::string key)</samp> and <samp>WWidget::tr(const std::string
  key)</samp>.
</p>

<p>
  To help with legacy code, WMessage is now a typedef for WString, but
  is deprecated and should not be used in new code. Unfortunately, the
  constructors <samp>WMessage(const char *text)</samp> and
  <samp>WMessage(const std::string text)</samp>, changed meaning!
  While previously they took a key to construct a localized message,
  they now take a literal text (the exact opposite!), since they are
  in fact plain WString() constructors. As a consequence your application
  will display key values instead of resolving those values (but will
  not break entirely).
</p>
<p>
  The new approach offers the benefit of only requiring one method
  signature for both literal and localizable text. This not only
  simplifies our work, but more importantly by using
  <samp>WString</samp> for displayed text in the API of your own
  widgets, localization (including the automatic language switching)
  comes automatically and is decided on by the user of your widget.
</p>
<p>
  Fortunately, there is a straightforward trick to handle most consequences
  of this change:
</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Replace <samp>WMessage(...)</samp> with <samp>tr(...)</samp>,</li>
   <li>add <samp>.value()</samp> when using the result of functions such
     as <samp>WText::text()</samp>,</li>
   <li>change your own classes to use <samp>WString</samp>
     wherever they expect some text that will be displayed, instead of
     std::string or WMessage.</li>
  </ul>

<h4>3) Wide string API</h4>

<p>
  Since Wt 2.0.0, the API for Wt has been changed to use WString
  instead of C++ narrow strings. WString supports both narrow and wide
  strings, and provides conversion between both. It does not provide
  string operations, however, and instead acts as a string
  container. You should convert to a C++ string type to perform
  operations. You should also not use WString outside of the user
  interface part of your application.
</p>

<h4>4) No more wmain()</h4>

<p>
  Previously, the Wt library implemented the <samp>main(int argc, char
  **argv)</samp> function, and called a <samp>wmain()</samp> function
  which created the WApplication instance.
</p>
<p>
  Wt 2.0.0 allows multiple applications to run within a single process.
  Therefore, the <samp>WApplication::exec()</samp> approach was no longer
  feasible. The new approach requires that:
</p>

  <ul>
    <li>your main function should look like this:
<pre>
int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  return Wt::WRun(argc, argv, &amp;createApplication);
}
</pre>
    </li>
    <li>where createApplication is a function of the following
      signature:

<pre>
Wt::WApplication *createApplication(const Wt::WEnvironment&amp; env)
{
  // return a new application object.
}
</pre>

    </li>
  </ul>

<h4>5) Configuration in /etc/wt/wt_config.xml</h4>

<p>
  Wt 2.0.0 uses a configuration file for a number of settings that 
  could previously be configured at build time of the library, or
  in the API. The latter functions are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><samp>WApplication::setMaximumRquestSize()</samp></li>
  <li><samp>WApplication::setIdleTimeout()</samp></li>  
</ul>

<h4>6) Removed obsolete classes</h4>

<p>
  Wt 2.0.0 removed a number of classes that were still in the widget
  tree, but have been obsoleted by more flexible classes:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><samp>WAbstractTab</samp>, <samp>WButtonTab</samp>, and <samp>WTabWidget</samp> are obsoleted by the more flexible <samp>WMenu</samp>.</li>
</ul>

<h4>7) Deprecate boost::regex from WRegExpValidator API</h4>

<p>
  The constructor and methods that takes a boost::regex object in
  the WRegExpValidator API have been deprecated, to remove the dependency
  on boost from the public API. You should consider the std::string based
  constructor and method instead.
</p>

<h4>8) WObject::emit() has been removed.</h4>

<p>
  Since Wt 1.99.1, we have removed WObject::emit() function. Instead,
  you may simply call the signal with its arguments, or use the
  explicit emit method (recommended).</p>

<p>
  To adapt your code, you should:
</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Replace all <samp>emit(MySignal(...))</samp> with <samp>MySignal(...)</samp> or <samp>MySignal.emit(...)</samp>
    </li>
  </ul>

<h4>9) WResource::streamResourceData() signature has changed.</h4>

<p>
  Since Wt 2.0.0, WResource::streamResourceData() returns a boolean value
  which indicates if all data has been streamed. If you have reimplemented
  WResource for your applications, you must update the signature and return
  true.
</p>
<p>
  The change is relevant only within the new server-push support that is
  now in Wt 2.0.0. This allows you to continuously append to the content
  of a resource.
</p>

<h4>10) Rename of WJavascriptSlot to JSlot.</h4>

<hr />

<h2>Release 1.1.7</h2>

This release contains lots of additions and improvements, but should
be completely backwards-compatible.

<hr />

<h2>Release 1.1.6</h2>

There is one change which will impact the behaviour of current applications:
Currently, on exit, by default the last widget updates are shown. So, no
more good-bye message. This changes slightly when one needs to redirect()
to a new location: not when WApplication::exec() returns, but during the
same event handling as when calling WApplication::quit().

<hr />

<h2>Release 1.1.5</h2>

Nothing special...

<hr />

<h2>Release 1.1.4</h2>

Changes to impact everybody, since the previous release:

<ul>
<li>
  The dependency for libxml++ (and its large number of dependencies) has
  been dropped, and replaced by Xerces-C++ (which has no further dependencies).
</li>
<li>
  Wt programs need to link against libwtfcgi.so, instead of libwt.so. In the
  future Wt will also support different web-connector systems besides
  FastCGI.
</li>
<li>
  The signatures of wmain() and WApplication constructor have changed:
  new signatures are:
  <ul>
    <li><samp>int wmain(const WEnvironment&amp; env)</samp></li>
    <li><samp>WApplication::WApplication(const WEnvironment&amp; env)</samp></li>
 </ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other changes:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Support for unicode is implemented, but perhaps needs more testing
  by non-Western people ? Only UTF-8 is supported currently.</li>
  <li>Addition of a WTimer class -- see mission example.</li>
  <li>Many bug fixes which should make Wt more robust against illegal CGI
    requests (which are ignored), and now Wt should exit cleanly in more
    (all?) circumstances.</li>
  <li>Addition of feed-back for pending AJAX requests (does not work yet on
    IE).</li>
  <li>Support for style sheets is improved: now inline decoration styles
    will override style sheet styles. See hangman or treelist examples.</li>
  <li>The browser can be redirected to a new page. This is useful when the
    application is terminated -- or to change during the application from
